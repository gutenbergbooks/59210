<h3 id="Introduction_h3">JOHN MADDISON MORTON.</h3>

<hr class="med"/>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">HE</span> present generation is familiar enough with “Box
and Cox,” that best and brightest of good old English farces, and hundreds of other plays
of the same kind, that were written years ago by one of the driest of humorists and most
genial of gentlemen; but few young play-goers, I take it, are aware how much the stage
owes to John Maddison Morton. Of the form and features of one of the most prolific writers
for the stage, I believe many of my own contemporaries to be absolutely ignorant. They
know little of his antecedents or history, and yet they, and their fathers before them,
have laughed right merrily over the quips and cranks, the quaint turns of expression, the
odd freaks of humor that distinguished a writer of fun belonging to the old school. No one
has ever filled the place left vacant by John Maddison Morton. Managers for many years
past have assumed that the public does not want farces, and are content to tolerate
badly-acted rubbish before the play of the evening begins. But a strong reaction is
setting in. The pit and gallery are not content any longer to remain open-mouthed while
the scenes of the play of the evening are being set, or to be deluded into applauding the
silly stuff that is nowadays served up as farce, and in which the principal actors and
actresses do not condescend to appear. Why, when I first began to consider myself a
regular<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> play-goer,
some five-and-twenty years ago, when I struggled with the young men of my time into the
pit, I could see, quite irrespective of the play of the evening, Webster at the Adelphi in
“One Touch of Nature,” say at seven o’clock in the evening; Toole and Paul Bedford and
Selby and Billington and Bob Romer, always in some favorite farce that began or ended the
evening’s amusement, at the Haymarket; Buckstone, old Rogers, and Chippendale in such
plays as “The Rough Diamond,” at the Haymarket, with an after-farce for Compton, Howe, and
Walter Gordon; and at the Strand such excellent little plays as “Short and Sweet” or the
“Fair Encounter,” in which we were sure to find Jemmy Rogers and Johnnie Clarke, and most
probably Belford, Marie Wilton, Fanny Josephs, and Miss Swanborough. In those days artists
were not above their business, which was, and ever should be, to amuse the public; they
were not taken up and patronized by society; they did not lecture their audiences, but
were modest, hard-working, and unassuming. There were no young fops in the ranks of the
dramatic profession with extravagant salaries and diminutive talent, and the young ladies
who adopted the profession had to work, and work hard, in order to obtain a name. Farces
were then well acted, for the simple reason that the best members of the company played in
them. It was worth paying for the pit at half or full price when Robson was set down for
“Retained for the Defence” or “Boots at the Swan,” and when Leigh Murray, most
accomplished of comedians, appeared in “His First Champagne.”</p>

<p>John Maddison Morton was born on January 3, 1811, at the lovely Thames-side village of
Pangborne, above Reading. His father was the famous dramatist Thomas Morton,<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> author of “Speed the
Plough,” “Town and Country,” “The Way to get Married,” “Secrets worth Knowing,” “Cure for
the Heartache,” “School of Reform,” etc. The elder Morton resided at Pangborne for
thirty-five years, and only removed to London in 1828. It must have been on the lovely
reaches, back-waters, and weirs of the lovely Thames that the future author of “Box and
Cox” acquired such a love of angling, and became so enthusiastic and excellent a
fisherman. A few years ago I was in the habit of meeting Maddison Morton at the hospitable
table of my old friend Robert Reece. They were both members of the old Dramatic Authors’
Society, and on committee days Reece would bring the jovial dramatist home to dinner,
when, over a glass of old port-wine, and with frequent intervals of snuff-taking, he would
delight us with stories of actors, and many adventures with the rod and line. In fact, he
told us that he devoted the best part of his after-life to two principal objects, “Fishing
and Farce-writing.”</p>

<p>But to return to his younger days. He was educated in Paris and Germany from 1817 to
1820. After that he went to school at Islington for a short time, and from 1820 to 1827 we
find the future dramatist at Dr. Richardson’s celebrated seminary at Clapham. Under the
roof of the famous author of the English dictionary he found, and soon took for
companions, Julian Young, Charles James Mathews, John Kemble, Henry Kemble, John Liston,
Dick Tattersall, young Terry, son of Terry the actor, whose widow subsequently married the
lexicographer, Dr. Richardson. In 1832 Maddison Morton was appointed to a clerkship in
Chelsea Hospital by Lord John Russell, but he did not appear to relish the desk any more
than his subsequent friends,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-viii">[Pg
viii]</a></span> W. S. Gilbert and Robert Reece. He did not wait patiently for a pension,
like Tom Taylor, Anthony Trollope, etc., but got sick of government office-work in 1840,
when he resigned his situation.</p>

<p>It was in April, 1835, that Maddison Morton produced his first farce at the little
theatre in Tottenham Street destined afterwards to flourish as the Prince of Wales
Theatre, and to be the nursery of Robertsonian comedy. The farce was called “My First Fit
of the Gout,” and the principal parts were played by Wrench, Morris Barrett, and Mrs.
Nisbett. As I have said before, Maddison Morton lived in the happy days when farces were
popular, when programmes were ample, and when actors were not ashamed of their work. Among
the cultivated artists who have played in Maddison Morton’s farces are the elder Farren,
Liston, Keeley, Buckstone, Wright, Compton, Harley, Robson, Mrs. Glover, Mrs. Stirling,
Charles Mathews, and many more of our own day, such as Toole, Howe, etc.</p>

<p>I once asked Maddison Morton some particulars concerning his subsequent career as a
dramatist, when he observed, quaintly enough, “My dear boy, it would never do for me to
blow my own trumpet. In the first place, I haven’t got one, and I am sure I could not blow
it if I had.” It is sometimes brought as a charge against Maddison Morton that his plays
are taken from the French, and as such are devoid of original merit. But how little such
as these understand Maddison Morton or his incomparable style. He may have borrowed his
plots from France, but what trace of French writing is to be found in the immortal “Box
and Cox,” or “Woodcock’s Little Game?” “Box and Cox” is taken from two French farces, one
called “Frisette,” and<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-ix">[Pg
ix]</a></span> the other “Une Chambre à Deux Lits,” but the writing of the farce as much
belongs to the man, and is as distinctly original and personal to him as anything ever
said or written by Henry James Byron. For my own poor part, I consider that Maddison
Morton is funnier than any writer for the stage in his day. It is the kind of dry,
sententious humor that tickles one far more than the extravagances, the puns, and the
strained tomfooleries of the modern writer of burlesque—the very burlesque that Maddison
Morton considers was the death-blow to the old-fashioned English farce. Players may yet
find it profitable to revive the taste for short farces, and they need not hesitate to do
so because several excellent and funny plays by the author of “Box and Cox” remain unused.
Benjamin Webster told Maddison Morton, not long before his death, that he had made more
money by farces than by any other description of drama. This is not difficult to account
for. The author was certainly not overpaid; the farces were evidently well acted; it cost
next to nothing to produce them, and if successful, the world and his wife went to see
them.</p>

<p>Writing to a friend the other day, Maddison Morton observes: “The introduction of
‘Burlesque’ gave the first ‘knock-down blow’ to the old-fashioned farce. I hoped against
hope that its popularity would return, and that some employment might still be found for
my pen. I was disappointed; and as the only means of discharging liabilities which I had
in the mean time unavoidably contracted, I was compelled to part with my copyrights, the
accumulation of a life’s laborious and not unsuccessful work.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Maddison Morton’s “Box and Cox” was the pioneer of the
movement that resulted<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-x">[Pg
x]</a></span> in the literary and musical partnership of Gilbert and Sullivan. If it had
not been for Burnand’s “Cox and Box,” in all probability the “Sorcerer” and the rest of
the operas would never have been written. And happily the reign of Maddison Morton is not
yet over. On Monday, December 7, 1885, was produced at Toole’s Theatre a three-act farce
called “Going It,” that kept the house in a continual roar of laughter. It is in the old
vein, bright, witty, and bristling with verbal quip. When the farce was over the call for
“author” was raised, but no one imagined that it would be responded to. To the surprise of
all, Mr. Toole led on an elderly gentleman of the old school, prim, neat, well set up, and
rosy-cheeked as a winter apple. This was Maddison Morton. At last the young play-goer had
seen the author of “Box and Cox.”</p>

<p>In the year 1881, on the nomination of her Majesty, this great and accomplished
gentleman, who never mixed in Bohemian or literary society, was appointed a “poor brother
of the Charter House.” Who that has read Thackeray is not familiar with the fine old
hospital of “Greyfriars,” and its pleasant old “codds,” under whose shadow and in whose
society Colonel Newcome breathed his last, and said “Adsum.” Here in this pleasant
retreat, quiet and retired although in the heart of the busiest part of the city, Maddison
Morton met another “brother,” John A. Heraud, a dramatist and dramatic critic who had
often sat in judgment on Morton’s plays. What chats about old times they must have within
those venerable walls that circle round the poet-dramatist and the dramatic farce-writer.
“Here,” writes Maddison Morton, in his well-known cheerful and contented frame of mind, “I
shall doubtless spend the short<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-xi">[Pg
xi]</a></span> time I may have to live, and then be laid in the quiet little church-yard
at Bow—not, I hope, entirely ‘unwept, unhonored, nor unsung.’”</p>

<p>Good, kindly, gentle heart thus to speak with such fervor and such faith in the long
evening of your days! Shut up in your cloistered home, the hearts of those who had the
honor and pleasure of knowing you often go out to you! And on the stage the laughter
evoked by your fanciful wit, and the true humor that sprung from your merry heart, will
soothe you and delight many more who honor your excellent name.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’ve half a mind to register an oath that I’ll
never have my hair cut again! (<i>His hair is very short.</i>) I look as if I had just
been cropped for the militia. And I was particularly<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span> emphatic in my instructions to the
hair-dresser only to cut the ends off. He must have thought I meant the other ends! Never
mind—I sha’n’t meet anybody to care about so early. Eight o’clock, I declare! I haven’t a
moment to lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual, particular, and peremptory of
hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny. (<i>Knock at <span

class="smallerfont">OUNCER</span>, <span class="stage">L</span>.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Good-morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept
comfortably, Mr. Cox?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I can’t say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged
to you if you could accommodate me with a more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one I’ve
got now seems to me to have about a handful and a half of feathers at each end, and
nothing whatever in the middle.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Thank you. Then perhaps you’ll be good enough to
hold this glass while I finish my toilet?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Certainly (<i>holding glass before </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span>,<i> who ties his cravat</i>). Why, I do declare, you’ve had
your hair cut.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Cut! It strikes me I’ve had it mowed! It’s very
kind of you to mention it, but I’m sufficiently conscious of the absurdity of my personal
appearance already. (<i>Puts on his coat.</i>) Now for my hat. (<i>Puts on his hat, which
comes over his eyes.</i>) That’s the effect of having one’s hair cut. This hat fitted me
quite tight before. Luckily I’ve got two or three more. (<i>Goes in at <span
class="stage">L</span>., and returns with three hats of different shapes, and puts them
on, one after the other—all of which are too big for him.</i>) This is pleasant! Never
mind. This one appears to me to wabble about rather less than the others. (<i>Puts on
hat.</i>) And now I’m off! By-the-bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your attention to a
fact that has been evident to me for some time past—and that is, that my coals go
remarkably fast—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Lor, Mr. Cox!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. It is not the case only with the coals, Mrs.
Bouncer, but I’ve lately observed a gradual and steady increase of evaporation among my
candles, wood, sugar, and lucifer-matches.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Lor, Mr. Cox! you surely don’t suspect me?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I don’t say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you
distinctly to understand that I don’t believe it’s the cat.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Is there anything else you’ve got to grumble
about, sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a
thing as a dictionary?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. No, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then I’ll lend you one; and if you turn to the
letter G, you’ll find “Grumble, verb neuter—to complain without a cause.” Now, that’s not
my case, Mrs. B.; and now that we are upon the subject, I wish to know how it is that I
frequently find my apartment full of smoke?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why—I suppose the chimney—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. The chimney doesn’t smoke tobacco. I’m speaking
of tobacco-smoke, Mrs. B. I hope, Mrs. Bouncer, <i>you’re</i> not guilty of cheroots or
Cubas?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Nor partial to a pipe?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. No, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then, how is it that—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why—I suppose—yes—that must be it—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. At present I am entirely of your opinion—because
I haven’t the most distant particle of an idea what you mean.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why, the gentleman who has got the attics is
hardly ever without a pipe in his mouth—and there he sits, with his feet upon the
mantle-piece—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. The mantle-piece! That strikes me as being a
considerable stretch, either of your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman’s legs. I
presume you mean the fender or the hob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Sometimes one, sometimes t’other. Well, there
he sits for hours, and puffs away into the fireplace.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Ah, then you mean to say that this gentleman’s
smoke, instead of emulating the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going <i>up</i>
the chimney, thinks proper to effect a singularity by taking the contrary direction?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then, I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking
of is the same individual that I invariably meet coming up-stairs when I’m going down, and
going down-stairs when I’m coming up!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why—yes—I—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. From the appearance of his outward man, I should
unhesitatingly set him down as a gentleman connected with the printing interest.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Yes, sir—and a very respectable young
gentleman he is.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, good-morning, Mrs. Bouncer.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. You’ll be back at your usual time, I suppose,
sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Yes—nine o’clock. You needn’t light my fire in
future, Mrs. B., I’ll do it myself. Don’t forget the bolster! (<i>Going, stops.</i>) A
halfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer; and be good enough to let it stand—I wish the cream
to accumulate.</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Exit at <span class="stage">L</span>. <span
class="stage">C</span>.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. He’s gone at last! I declare I was all in a
tremble for fear Mr. Box would come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they’ve never met
yet; and what’s more, they’re not very likely to do so; for Mr. Box is hard at work at a
newspaper office all night, and doesn’t come home till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy
making hats all day long, and doesn’t come home till night; so that I’m getting double
rent for my room, and neither of my lodgers is any the wiser for it. It was a capital idea
of mine—that it was! But I haven’t an instant to lose. First of all, let me put Mr. Cox’s
things out of Mr. Box’s way. (<i>She takes the</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span> <i>three hats, </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> dressing-gown and
slippers, opens door at <span class="stage">L</span>. and puts them in, then shuts door
and locks it.</i>) Now, then, to put the key where Mr. Cox always finds it. (<i>Puts the
key on the ledge of the door, <span class="stage">L</span>.</i>) I really must beg Mr. Box
not to smoke so much. I was so dreadfully puzzled to know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke
about it. Now, then, to make the bed; and don’t let me forget that what’s the head of the
bed for Mr. Cox becomes the foot of the bed for Mr. Box—people’s tastes do differ so.
(<i>Goes behind the curtains of the bed, and seems to be making it; then appears with a
very thin bolster in her hand.</i>) The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of such a
bolster as this! (<i>She disappears again behind curtains.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>without</i>). Pooh—pooh! Why don’t you keep
your own side of the staircase, sir? (<i>Enters at back, dressed as a printer. Puts his
head out at door again, shouting.</i>) It was as much your fault as mine, sir! I say,
sir—it was as much your fault as mine, sir!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. (<i>emerging from behind the curtains of
bed</i>). Lor, Mr. Box! what is the matter?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Mind your own business, Bouncer!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in,
to be sure! I declare you’re quite pale in the face!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. What color would you have a man be who has been
setting up long leaders for a daily paper all night?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. But, then, you’ve all the day to yourself.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>looking significantly at </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B<span class="smallerfont">OUNCER</span>). So it seems! Far
be it from me, Bouncer, to hurry your movements, but I think it right to acquaint you with
my immediate intention of divesting myself of my garments, and going to bed.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Oh, Mr. Box! (<i>going</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is
that I invariably encounter going down-stairs when I’m coming up, and coming up-stairs
when I’m going down?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. (<i>confused</i>). Oh—yes—the gentleman in the
attic, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Oh! There’s nothing particularly remarkable about
him, except his hats. I meet him in all sorts of hats—white hats and black hats—hats with
broad brims and hats with narrow brims—hats with naps and hats without naps—in short, I
have come to the conclusion that he must be individually and professionally associated
with the hatting interest.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Yes, sir. And, by-the-bye, Mr. Box, he begged
me to request of you, as a particular favor, that you would not smoke quite so much.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Did he? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with
my compliments, that if he objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better domesticate
himself in some adjoining parish.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Oh, Mr. Box! you surely wouldn’t deprive me of
a lodger? (<i>pathetically</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. It would come to precisely the same thing,
Bouncer; because if I detect the slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you
warning that I shall give you warning at once.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Well, Mr. Box—do you want anything more of
me?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. On the contrary—I’ve had quite enough of you!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Well, if ever! What next, I wonder?</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Goes out at <span class="stage">L</span>. <span
class="stage">C</span>., slamming door after her.</i></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. It’s quite extraordinary, the trouble I always
have to get rid of that venerable female! She knows I’m up all night, and yet she seems to
set her face against my indulging in a horizontal position by day. Now, let me see—shall I
take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or shall I take my breakfast before I swallow
my nap—I mean, shall I swallow my nap before— No; never mind! I’ve got a rasher of bacon
somewhere (<i>feeling in his pockets</i>). I’ve the most distinct and vivid recollection
of having purchased a rasher of bacon— Oh, here it is (<i>produces it, wrapped in paper,
and places it on table</i>); and a penny roll. The next thing is to light the fire. Where
are my lucifers? (<i>Looking on mantle-piece, <span class="stage">R</span>., and taking
box, opens it.</i>) Now, ’pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer—this is, by several
degrees, too bad!<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
I had a whole boxful three days ago, and now there’s only one! I’m perfectly aware that
she purloins my coals and my candles and my sugar, but I did think—oh, yes, I did think
that my lucifers would be sacred! (<i>Takes candlestick off the mantle-piece, <span
class="stage">R</span>., in which there is a very small end of candle; looks at it.</i>)
Now I should like to ask any unprejudiced person or persons their opinion touching this
candle. In the first place, a candle is an article that I don’t require, because I’m only
at home in the day-time; and I bought this candle on the first of May—Chimney-sweepers’
Day—calculating that it would last me three months, and here’s one week not half over, and
the candle three parts gone! (<i>Lights the fire; then takes down a gridiron which is
hanging over the fireplace, <span class="stage">R</span>.</i>) Mrs. Bouncer has been using
my gridiron! The last article of consumption that I cooked upon it was a pork-chop, and
now it is powerfully impregnated with the odor of red herrings! (<i>Places gridiron on
fire, and then with fork lays rasher of bacon on the gridiron.</i>) How sleepy I am, to be
sure! I’d indulge myself with a nap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning
of my bacon. (<i>Yawning again.</i>) Perhaps it will turn itself. I must lie down—so, here
goes. (<i>Lies on the bed, closing the curtains round him. After a short pause—</i></p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>,<i> hurriedly, <span
class="stage">L</span>. <span class="stage">C</span>.</i></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of
being eleven minutes and a half behind time, I was sneaking into the shop, in a state of
considerable excitement, when my venerable employer, with a smile of extreme benevolence
on his aged countenance, said to me, “Cox, I sha’n’t want you to-day; you can have a
holiday.” Thoughts of “Gravesend and back—fare, One Shilling,” instantly suggested
themselves, intermingled with visions of “Greenwich for Fourpence!” Then came the Twopenny
Omnibuses, and the Halfpenny boats—in short, I’m quite bewildered! However, I must have my
breakfast first—that’ll give me time to reflect. I’ve bought a mutton-chop, so I
sha’n’t<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span> want any
dinner. (<i>Puts chop on table.</i>) Good gracious! I’ve forgot the bread. Holloa! what’s
this? A roll, I declare! Come, that’s lucky! Now, then, to light the fire. Holloa!
(<i>seeing the lucifer-box on table</i>) who presumes to touch my box of lucifers? Why,
it’s empty! I left one in it—I’ll take my oath I did. Heyday! Why, the fire <i>is</i>
lighted! Where’s the gridiron? On the fire, I declare! And what’s that on it? Bacon? Bacon
it is! Well, now, ’pon my life, there’s a quiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer’s proceedings
that’s almost amusing. She takes my last lucifer—my coals and my gridiron to cook her
breakfast by! No, no—I can’t stand this! Come out of that! (<i>Pokes fork into bacon, and
puts it on a plate on the table; then places his chop on the gridiron, which he puts on
the fire.</i>) Now, then, for my breakfast-things. (<i>Taking key, hung up, <span
class="stage">L</span>., opens door <span class="stage">L</span>. and goes out slamming
the door after him with a loud noise.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>suddenly showing his head from behind the
curtains</i>). Come in! if it’s you, Mrs. Bouncer—you needn’t be afraid. I wonder how long
I’ve been asleep? (<i>Suddenly recollecting.</i>) Goodness gracious—my bacon! (<i>Leaps
off bed and runs to the fireplace.</i>) Holloa! what’s this? A chop! Whose chop? Mrs.
Bouncer’s, I’ll be bound. She thought to cook her breakfast while I was asleep—with my
coals, too—and my gridiron! Ha, ha! But where’s my bacon? (<i>Seeing it on table.</i>)
Here it is. Well, ’pon my life. Bouncer’s going it! And shall I curb my indignation? shall
I falter in my vengeance? No! (<i>Digs the fork into the chop, opens window, and throws
chop out; shuts window again.</i>) So much for Bouncer’s breakfast; and now for my own!
(<i>With the fork he puts the bacon on the gridiron again.</i>) I may as well lay my
breakfast-things. (<i>Goes to mantle-piece at <span class="stage">R</span>., takes key out

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Why, to-morrow—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’ll take it!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. So will I!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Excuse me—but if you both take it, you may
just as well stop where you are.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span><i> and </i>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>.
True.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I spoke first, sir—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. With all my heart, sir. The little back
second-floor room is yours, sir—now, go—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Go? Pooh—pooh!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Now don’t quarrel, gentlemen. You see, there
used to be a partition here—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span><i> and </i>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>.
Then put it up!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Nay, I’ll see if I can’t get the other room
ready this very day. Now <i>do</i> keep your tempers.</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Exit <span class="stage">L</span>.</i></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. What a disgusting position! (<i>walking rapidly
round stage</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>sitting down on chair at one side of table,
and following </i>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>’<span

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I shall not do anything of the sort, sir
(<i>seating himself at the table opposite</i> B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir! However, don’t let me prevent
<i>you</i> from going out.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Don’t flatter yourself, sir. (C<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span><i> is about to break a piece of the roll off.</i>) Holloa!
that’s my roll, sir. (<i>Snatches it away, puts a pipe in his mouth, lights it with a
piece of tinder, and puffs smoke across to </i>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>.)</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Holloa! What are you about, sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. What am I about? I’m about to smoke.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Wheugh! (<i>Goes and opens window at </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> back.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Holloa! (<i>Turns round.</i>) Put down that
window, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then put your pipe out, sir!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. There! (<i>Puts pipe on table.</i>)</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. There! (<i>Slams down window and reseats
himself.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I shall retire to my pillow. (<i>Goes up, takes

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>jumps up, goes to bed, and sits down on <span

sir—I cannot allow any one to rumple my bed. (<i>Both rising.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Your bed? Hark ye, sir—can you fight?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No? Then come on (<i>sparring at </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Sit down, sir, or I’ll instantly vociferate
“Police!”</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>seats himself. </i>C<span

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Although we are doomed to occupy the same room
for a few hours longer, I don’t see any necessity for our cutting each other’s throats,
sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Not at all. It’s an operation that I should
decidedly object to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. And, after all, I’ve no violent animosity to you,
sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Nor have I any rooted antipathy to you, sir.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Besides, it was all Mrs. Bouncer’s fault,
sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Entirely, sir (<i>gradually approaching
chairs</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir! (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Take a bit of roll, sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Thank ye, sir (<i>breaking a bit off.
Pause</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Do you sing, sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I sometimes join in a chorus.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then give us a chorus. (<i>Pause.</i>) Have you
seen the Bosjemans, sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, sir—my wife wouldn’t let me.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Your <i>wife!</i></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. That is—my <i>intended</i> wife.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, that’s the same thing! I congratulate you
(<i>shaking hands</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>with a deep sigh</i>). Thank ye. (<i>Seeing
</i>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span><i> about to get up.</i>) You needn’t disturb
yourself, sir. She won’t come here.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Oh! I understand. You’ve got a snug little
establishment of your own <i>here</i>—on the sly—cunning dog (<i>nudging </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>drawing himself up</i>). No such thing, sir; I
repeat, sir, no such thing, sir; but my wife—I mean, my intended wife—happens to be the
proprietor of a considerable number of bathing-machines—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Ha! Where? (<i>grasping
</i>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i>
arm</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. At a favorite watering-place. How curious you
are!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Not at all. Well?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Consequently, in the bathing season—which luckily
is rather a long one—we see but little of each other; but as that is now over, I am daily
indulging in the expectation of being blessed with the sight of <i>my</i> beloved (<i>very
seriously</i>). Are <i>you</i> married?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Me? Why—not exactly!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Ah—a happy bachelor!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Why—not—precisely!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Oh! a—widower?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No—not absolutely!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. You’ll excuse me, sir—but at present I don’t
exactly understand how you can help being one of the three.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Not help it?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, sir—not you, nor any other man alive!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Ah, that may be—but I’m not alive!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>pushing back his chair</i>). You’ll excuse me,
sir, but I don’t like joking upon such subjects.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’m perfectly serious, sir. I’ve been defunct for
the last three years.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>shouting</i>). Will you be quiet, sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. If you won’t believe me, I’ll refer you to a very
large, numerous, and respectable circle of disconsolate friends.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. My dear sir—my <i>very</i> dear sir—if there does
exist any ingenious contrivance whereby a man on the eve of committing matrimony can leave
this world, and yet stop in it, I shouldn’t be sorry to know it.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Oh! then I presume I’m not to set you down as
being frantically attached to your intended?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Why, not exactly; and yet, at present, I’m only
aware of one obstacle to doating upon her, and that is, that I can’t abide her!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then there’s nothing more easy. Do as I did.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). I will! What was it?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Drown yourself!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>shouting again</i>). Will you be quiet,
sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Listen to me. Three years ago it was my
misfortune to captivate the affections of a still blooming, though somewhat middle-aged
widow, at Ramsgate.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). Singular enough! Just my case
three months ago at Margate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, sir, to escape her importunities, I came to
the determination of enlisting into the Blues, or Lifeguards.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). So did I. How very odd!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. But they wouldn’t have me—they actually had the
effrontery to say that I was too short—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). And I wasn’t tall enough!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. So I was obliged to content myself with a
marching regiment—I enlisted!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). So did I. Singular
coincidence!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’d no sooner done so than I was sorry for
it.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). So was I.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. My infatuated widow offered to purchase my
discharge, on condition that I’d lead her to the altar.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). Just my case!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I hesitated—at last I consented.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). I consented at once!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, sir, the day fixed for the happy ceremony
at length drew near—in fact, too near to be pleasant—so I suddenly discovered that I
wasn’t worthy to possess her, and I told her so; when, instead of being flattered by the
compliment, she flew upon me like a tiger of the female gender. I rejoined—when suddenly
something whizzed past me, within an inch of my ear, and shivered into a thousand
fragments against the mantle-piece—it was the slop-basin. I retaliated with a teacup—we
parted, and the next morning I was served with a notice of action for breach of
promise.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Well, sir, ruin stared me in the face—the action
proceeded against me with gigantic strides. I took a desperate resolution; I left my home
early one morning, with one suit of clothes on my back, and another tied up in a bundle
under my arm. I arrived on the cliffs, opened my bundle, deposited the suit of clothes on
the very verge of the precipice, took one look<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span> down into the yawning gulf beneath me, and walked off in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Dear me! I think I begin to have some slight
perception of your meaning. Ingenious creature! You disappeared—the suit of clothes was
found—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Exactly; and in one of the pockets of the coat,
or the waistcoat, or the pantaloons—I forget which—there was also found a piece of paper,
with these affecting farewell words: “This is thy work, oh, Penelope Ann!”</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Penelope Ann! (<i>Starts up, takes </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">OX</span><i> by the arm, and leads him slowly to front of stage.</i>)
Penelope Ann?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Penelope Ann!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Originally widow of William Wiggins?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Widow of William Wiggins.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Proprietor of bathing-machines?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Proprietor of bathing-machines!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. At Margate?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. And Ramsgate!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. It must be she! And you, sir—you are Box—the
lamented, long lost Box!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I am.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. And I was about to marry the interesting creature
you so cruelly deceived.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Ha! then you are Cox?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I am.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I heard of it. I congratulate you—I give you joy!
And now I think I’ll go and take a stroll (<i>going</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No you don’t! (<i>stopping him</i>). I’ll not
lose sight of you till I’ve restored you to the arms of your intended.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. <i>My</i> intended? You mean <i>your</i>
intended.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, sir—yours!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. How can she be <i>my</i> intended, now that I’m
drowned?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. You’re no such thing, sir! and I prefer
presenting you to Penelope Ann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’ve no wish to be introduced to your
intended.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. <i>My</i> intended? How can that be, sir? You
proposed to her first!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. What of that, sir? I came to an untimely end, and
you popped the question afterwards.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. You are much more worthy of her than I am, sir.
Permit me, then, to follow the generous impulse of my nature—I give her up to you.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Benevolent being! I wouldn’t rob you for the
world! (<i>Going.</i>) Good-morning, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>seizing him</i>). Stop!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Unhand me, hatter! or I shall cast off the lamb
and assume the lion!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Pooh! (<i>snapping his fingers close to
</i>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i>
face</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. An insult! to my very face!—under my very nose!
(<i>rubbing it</i>). You know the consequences, sir—instant satisfaction, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. With all my heart, sir! (<i>They go to the
fireplace, <span class="stage">R</span>., and begin ringing bells violently, and pull down
bell-pulls.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OTH</span>. Mrs. Bouncer! Mrs. Bouncer!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. B. Yes, sir (<i>going</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Stop! You don’t mean to say, thoughtless and
imprudent woman, that you keep loaded fire-arms in the house?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I think it’s a barbarous practice, sir.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. So do I, sir. To be sure, I don’t so much object
to it when the pistols are not loaded.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No; I dare say that <i>does</i> make some
difference.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. And yet, sir, on the other hand, doesn’t it
strike you as rather a waste of time for two people to keep firing pistols at each other
with nothing in ’em?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, sir—not more than any other harmless
recreation.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Hark ye! Why do you object to marry Penelope
Ann?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Because, as I’ve observed already, I can’t abide
her. You’ll be very happy with her.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Happy? Me! With the consciousness that I have
deprived <i>you</i> of such a treasure? No, no, Cox!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Don’t think of me, Box—I shall be sufficiently
rewarded by the knowledge of my Box’s happiness.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Don’t be absurd, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Then don’t you be ridiculous, sir!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I won’t have her!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I won’t have her!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I have it! Suppose we draw lots for the lady—eh,
Mr. Cox?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. That’s fair enough, Mr. Box.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Or, what say you to dice?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. With all my heart! Dice, by all means
(<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). That’s lucky! Mrs. Bouncer’s
nephew left a pair here yesterday. He sometimes persuades me to have a throw for a trifle,
and as he always throws sixes, I suspect they are good ones. (<i>Goes to the cupboard at
<span class="stage">R</span>., and brings out the dice-box.</i>)</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>aside</i>). I’ve no objection at all to dice.
I lost one pound seventeen and sixpence at last Barnet Races, to a very
gentlemanly-looking man who had a most peculiar knack of throwing sixes; I suspected they
were loaded, so I gave him another half-crown, and he gave me the dice. (<i>Takes dice out
of his pocket; uses lucifer-box as substitute for dice-box, which is on table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Now, then, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. I’m ready, sir! (<i>They seat themselves at
opposite sides of the table.</i>) Will you lead off, sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. As you please, sir. The lowest throw, of course,
wins Penelope Ann?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Of course, sir.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span> (<i>rattling dice and throwing</i>). Sixes!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. That’s not a bad throw of yours, sir.
(<i>Rattling dice—throws.</i>) Sixes!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. That’s a pretty good one of yours, sir.

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Yours seem pretty good ones, sir.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Suppose we change?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Very well, sir. (<i>They change dice.</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Me, sir?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. Of course. You don’t suppose I’m going to read a

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. My intended! Pooh! It’s addressed to you—C, O,

bereft you of your intended wife.” He means <i>your</i> intended!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OX</span>. No, <i>yours!</i> However, it’s perfectly
immaterial—but she unquestionably was yours.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Cousin Martha, you are wrong, wrong, wrong! a
thousand times wrong!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Cousin Samuel, I’m right, right, right!
<i>ten</i> thousand times right!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>aside</i>). Obstinate old woman!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>aside</i>). Pig-headed old man!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. What possible reason can you have for setting
your face against Josephine’s getting married? It’s downright tyranny! Call yourself an
aunt, indeed!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. My reason is a very simple one. Her elder
sister, Julia, must find a husband first.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. First come, first served—eh? Really, my dear
Martha, I must say that, for a sensible woman, you are by many degrees the most
prejudiced, the most self-willed, the most—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Of course I am! But you know very well that
when I once <i>do</i> make up my mind to anything—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. You stick to it like a fly to a
“catch-’em-alive-oh.”</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. I don’t choose that Julia should suffer what
<i>I</i> did! <i>I</i> had a sister, Dorothy Jane, four years my junior, who married
before I did—do you think that was pleasant?—who supplied me with a sprinkling of nephews
and nieces before <i>I</i> had a husband—do you think that was pleasant?—who gave
garden-parties, balls, concerts, to which all the world flocked, and surrounded her with
flattery, adulation, while <i>I</i> was neglected, extinguished, regularly snuffed out. Do
you think <i>that</i> was pleasant? Well, it is <i>this</i> humiliation that I am
determined to spare Julia.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Well, you didn’t lose much by waiting. I’m sure
Tom Templeton was as good a creature as ever breathed—didn’t live long, poor fellow, but
cut up remarkably well considering.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Leaving his two nieces, his brother’s
children, to my charge, with ten thousand pounds each.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. As a wedding portion, which, I must say, you
didn’t seem in a hurry to part with.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. You know my conditions. You have only to find
a husband for Julia.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. I? When she refused half the good-looking fellows
within ten miles round! If she <i>does</i> mean to marry, she takes her time about it,
that I will say; it never seems to occur to her that she’s keeping her poor sister out in
the cold!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. You may be mistaken, cousin. I spoke to Julia
only yesterday, and she expressed herself in terms which convinced me that, were she to
receive a suitable offer—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. She’d accept it? Well, I’m glad she’s coming to
her senses at last; and I shall go away all the more comfortable in my mind.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Go away?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Yes. I’m off back again to Cheltenham. Touch of
gout<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg 37]</a></span>—liver queer;
besides, my work here is done. Your husband’s affairs, which I confess appeared to me at
first sight to be in a state of hopeless confusion, are now clearly and satisfactorily
arranged, thanks to my young colleague, Harry Barton, who, I must say, worked like a
nigger over them. By-the-bye, he’s another victim to Miss Julia’s caprice and
fastidiousness—she actually snubbed the poor fellow before she’d time even to look at him,
much less know him.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Well, you’ll confess he bears his
disappointment with becoming resignation (<i>satirically</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Yes, he’s getting used to it, like the eels. He
doesn’t see the use of crying over spilt milk. By-the-bye, there’s another matter of five
thousand pounds coming to the girls out of the Hampshire property. But Barton will give
you all the particulars.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. I’m sure, cousin, I feel deeply indebted to
you.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Not half as much as you <i>ought</i> to feel to
Harry Barton. Hasn’t he been here twice a week for the last month, up to his elbows in
leases, loans, mortgages, and the deuce knows what? Oh! here he comes.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Not at all. I am aware, Mr. Barton, how deeply
I am in your debt; but now that the business which served as your first introduction here
is satisfactorily concluded, pray remember my house is open to you as before (B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i> bows</i>). You will kindly excuse me now—a few orders
to give (<i>courtesies and exit <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Wait a minute! (<i>looking after </i>M<span

class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span>), you dear, good, kind old uncle. Uncle is it, or
cousin? I never know which.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Don’t you? It’s simple enough. Your mother’s
elder brother’s second—never mind. Call me uncle.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Well? Have you spoken to Aunt Martha?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes. Have you broken the ice?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Cracked it, that’s all!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. And what was the result? Did she consent or
not?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Did she say yes or no?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Why don’t you speak?
(<i>impatiently</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Why don’t you say something? (<i>ditto</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. How the deuce can I, when you won’t let me get in
a word edgeways? Well, then, my poor young friends, sorry I’ve no good news for you; the
old story over again—Miss Julia stops the way.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. And yet Mrs. Templeton’s pressing invitation to
me to visit at her house—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Is easily explained. She doesn’t even suspect
that your affections have been transferred from her elder to her younger niece.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Then you should have told her—then there
would have been an explosion!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Yes, which would have blown Master Harry clean
out of the street door! No, no! don’t despair; Julia will find a husband—sooner or
later!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Sooner or later? But what am <i>I</i> to do
in the mean time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes! what are <i>we</i> to do in the mean
time?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. I’m sure she’s had plenty of offers; but
one was too young—another was too old—one was too rich—another wasn’t rich enough; even
poor Harry here, though he followed her about like her shadow, and I’m sure made himself
sufficiently ridiculous—even <i>he</i> wasn’t good enough for her ladyship! It’s downright
absurd being so particular. I’m sure <i>I</i> wasn’t!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. No, dear Jo! <i>you</i> took pity on me at
once.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. No, not <i>quite</i> at once. I didn’t
<i>jump</i> at you. But what—what is to be done?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Have patience!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Patience? <i>Haven’t</i> I been patient for
the last five weeks?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Five weeks and three days!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Five weeks and three days!
(<i>suddenly</i>). Oh! such an idea! such a capital notion! Listen. Julia must find a
husband, or a husband must be found for Julia—that’s a settled point.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Dear Josephine! What a contrast to her cold,
insensible, apathetic sister! I, who loved her so sincerely, so devotedly, made such a
thorough spooney of myself! and was even weak enough to believe I was not quite
indifferent to her! I confess I felt hurt—considerably hurt—infernally hurt; but if she
flattered herself I should be inconsolable, she never was more mistaken in her life! She
little dreamt how soon I should find a cure for my infatuation in the charms of her
angelic sister! Dear Josephine! And to think there’s no hope of my calling her mine till
we find somebody to call her sister <i>his!</i> By-the-bye, here are a few papers I must
look over (<i>seating himself at table and opening papers</i>).</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>heard without</i>). Very well; take my card

Mrs. Templeton?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Oh! One of the family, perhaps? Possibly a
friend?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes, sir, a friend. (<i>Aside.</i>) He’s very
inquisitive!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>looking at album</i>). What charming
water-colors—perfect gems!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. They are the work of Mrs. Templeton’s elder
niece. Are <i>you</i> an artist?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. No, merely an amateur. And you?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. A humble member of the legal profession.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. A lawyer—eh? (<i>Aside.</i>) By Jove! here’s a
chance for me! I’ve half a mind to—he looks the very picture of good-nature, and six and
eightpence won’t ruin me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Might I venture, sir, on so very slight an
acquaintance, to solicit your professional opinion? (B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i> bows.</i>) It is rather a delicate subject, a very
<i>peculiar</i> subject.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I’m all attention, sir, merely observing that
the sooner you begin—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. The sooner I shall have done. Exactly. Then I’ll
come to the point at once. I would ask you whether, in your opinion, a promise of
marriage, written under <i>certain circumstances</i> and under certain <i>conditions,</i>
must necessarily be binding?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Such conditions being—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. First and foremost—that the lady should have her
head altered!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>astonished</i>). Have her head altered?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. I mean, have her hair dyed!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Which condition the lady has not complied
with?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. No, sir! It’s as red as ever!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Then, sir, I’ve no hesitation in saying that the
promise falls to the ground.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Thank you, sir (<i>seizing </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand and shaking
it—aside and sighing</i>). Poor Sophia!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. May I inquire the name of my <i>new</i> client?
(<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Royston.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. The Roystons of Banbury?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, Banbury—where the cakes come from.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I was aware that Mrs. Templeton expected you on
a matter of business—a certain sum of money, I believe?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, coming to the family from some Hampshire
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I imagined Mr. Royston was a much older
person.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. I see! You mean Jonathan.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Jonathan?</p>

<p>Rots. Yes, my brother—the head of the firm—he’s twenty years my senior! But as he could
not spare the time to come, he sent me.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside</i>). It’s worth the trial—decidedly
worth it! (<i>looking aside at </i>R<span class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span>). Young,
gentlemanly, sufficiently good-looking, good family! Here goes! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Excuse my
candor, but I think I guess your motive in putting the professional question you did just
now. <i>You</i> are the writer of the promise of marriage, and you are desirous of
contracting <i>another</i> alliance—eh?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. <i>I</i> don’t care about it, but Jonathan does!
(<i>Aside, and sighing again.</i>) Poor Sophia!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Perhaps you have some party in view?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. No. But I’m on the lookout.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. And, no doubt, anxious to succeed?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Not particularly—but Jonathan is.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Perhaps that is the object of your visit
<i>here?</i></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Eh? Is there a marriageable young lady here?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. I should like to see her.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Nothing more easy.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. What age?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Twenty.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Any fortune?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Ten thousand.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. That’d just suit Jonathan! Pretty?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Charming!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. That’d just suit <i>me!</i> Egad, suppose I try

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>suddenly seeing </i>B<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Babies!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. We went to the same school together!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Of course we did!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. At Tunbridge Wells!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, at Bagnigge Wells!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. And we have been friends ever since!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>enthusiastically</i>). <i>Bosom friends!</i>
And you’ll really do all you can to serve me?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Of course I will! (<i>Aside.</i>) And myself at

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. A thousand thanks, my dear— By-the-bye, what
shall I call you?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Harry. And you?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Basil (<i>grasping </i>B<span

might scratch your eyes out, but Jonathan will bless you.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Hush! (<i>seeing </i>M<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. I am here, madam, as my brother’s

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. I am aware of it. Mr. Barton, allow me to

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. No necessity for it, madam. Basil is an old
friend of mine.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, madam! I little thought of meeting an old
schoolfellow here (<i>shaking </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>’<span

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside to him</i>). Harry!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Harry!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. So you were school-fellows—eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, ma’am, at—Bagnigge Wells.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>hastily aside to him</i>). Tunbridge!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Of course! Tunbridge!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. You must have had some difficulty in
recognizing each other?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. <i>I</i> had—very <i>considerable</i>
difficulty, I assure you!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. We should have met earlier, no doubt, but for my
friend’s lengthened absence in Italy (<i>significantly to </i>R<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes. Ah! charming country—for those who don’t
mind the cold! (<i>On a sign from</i> B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>.) I mean the
heat!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>aside and looking at </i>R<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. At your service, colonel.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. You are acquainted, then?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. I was intimate with his mother’s family—indeed, I

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside</i>). This is deuced awkward!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. The Blue Coat school? I thought you said
Tunbridge Wells?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>recollecting</i>). Yes; that was before—I
mean after—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>aside and suspiciously</i>). I suspect these

you, Cousin Samuel, what is the opinion you have formed of him?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>). Oh! she’s the sister—eh?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>with pretended indifference</i>). Yes, a
little, harmless, insignificant school-girl—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Still, I repeat, if I had to choose between
them—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Pshaw! my dear fellow, if you only knew what
nonsense you’re talking! (<i>Aside.</i>) Zounds! I hope he isn’t going to fall in love
with Josephine!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Sorry to interrupt, but my time is precious, and
business must be attended to. Mr. Royston, will you step into the dining-room with your
papers? Barton, you’ll come too?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>hastily aside to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>). I understand it all, Harry. A very nice young man,
indeed! and likely to stand a good chance. Don’t you think so? Where <i>did</i> you pick
him up so soon?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Hush! I’ll explain everything another time.</p>

<p class="direction_3">[C<span class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span><i> and </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T<span class="smallerfont">EMPLETON</span><i> exeunt at
<span class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>., followed by </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i> and </i>R<span class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span>.
R<span class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span><i> stops, turns, and makes a profound bow to
</i>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i>
pushes him out.</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>aside</i>). I wonder what she thinks of
him? (<i>Aloud.</i>) A very gentlemanly young man, Mr. Royston, don’t you think so,
Julia?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>indifferently</i>). I scarcely looked at
him.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>aside</i>). That’s not very encouraging!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) How <i>do</i> you manage to find so many admirers? <i>I</i> can’t!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Hitherto, perhaps, I may have
had the lion’s share of attention, homage, and professed admiration; but <i>your</i> turn
will come.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. It’s a long time about it! You are so
difficult to please. And poor Mr. Royston, I suppose, will be snubbed like the rest!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>reprovingly</i>). Josephine! surely you
don’t imagine—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. That there is some attraction for him here?
Of<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-47">[Pg 47]</a></span> course I do! It
can’t be Aunt Martha—nor I! <i>I’m</i> only a <i>child!</i> (<i>with affected
humility</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Josephine, you speak as though you were piqued,
vexed—I might almost say <i>envious!</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Envious? I? Of what?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>sighing</i>). Of what, indeed! Ah, dear one,
the privileges of an elder sister are not so enviable after all! What is often her lot?—to
be constantly exposed to flattery—adulation from the lips of strangers—compelling her to
assume an extreme reserve in order to modify the exaggerated and at times indelicate
encomiums of relatives and friends. What is the necessary result? Doubt, distrust,
suspicion—nay, even prejudice, oftentimes unjust, against those who profess a desire to
please! On this impulse <i>I</i> have acted—an impulse dictated by self-respect and a due
sense of my own dignity!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>aside</i>). What a serious tone!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) But just think how cruelly, how unjustly you <i>may</i> have acted. And
I’m sure, as for Mr. Royston—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Mr. Royston again! Silly child!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Child? Perhaps I could mention a little
fact that—that—but I won’t! (<i>Aside.</i>) Good-by to my secret if I did! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Good-by!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Are you going to leave me too?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Haven’t I got to write out all the
invitations for our ball on the 23d?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Your birthday?—true.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Yes; that is the <i>professed</i>
reason—but of course it is on <i>your</i> account that it is given.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Josephine!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. I know a younger sister’s duty, Miss
Templeton (<i>makes a low courtesy and exit <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>.</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Josephine! sister!—Did she but know how she
misjudges me! How heavily I have been punished for that pride, that apparent
insensibility, with which she reproaches me! Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Harry! Harry! could you but tell how bitterly I have
repented! But surely, surely the cruel, wicked indifference with which I treated his
affection, his devotion, cannot have entirely destroyed them—some <i>little</i> spark of
the old flame must still remain! else why is he so constantly here? Why does he still seem
to seek my presence? At any rate, he shall see that I am no heartless coquette; and when
this Mr. Royston presents himself, as I’m sure he <i>will</i> (<i>seeing </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span>,<i> who enters from <span
class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.</i>)— I thought so!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). She’s alone! She’s decidedly
handsome. Yet, as I said before, there’s something about the other that—that— (<i>Aloud,
and bowing to </i>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>.) Miss Templeton!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>courtesying</i>). Sir! the business matter
in which you are engaged is, I presume, settled?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes; the signatures alone are required.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. In that case perhaps I had better— (<i>About to
retire.</i>)</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. One moment, I beg! (<i>Aside.</i>) She’s
decidedly <i>very</i> handsome! Still—don’t know how it is—but there is certainly
something about the other that—that— (<i>Aloud.</i>) Before leaving this house to-morrow,
with my new acquaintance—I mean <i>my old friend</i> Barton—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Mr. Barton leaves
to-morrow?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes, alas! I say “alas,” because one day only is
now left for me to admire your physical attractions, your mental accomplishments—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Oh, sir! Believe me, my sister is far more
accomplished than I am.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Far be it from me to deny it. Still, from the
highly eulogistic terms in which every one speaks of you—your sister among the first—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Ah, sir! Dear Josephine is so amiable, so
affectionate, so good, so loving, so angelic—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). She sticks up for her sister,
that I will say! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Still, there are <i>certain</i> attractions which we can
all judge of by our own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>quickly</i>). And who can possess them to a
greater degree than Josephine? Such exquisite grace—such absolute perfection of form and
feature—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). Her sister again! If we go on at
this rate, we sha’n’t get on very fast! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Allow me to be frank with you; my
brother Jonathan—but perhaps you’ve never heard of Jonathan?—Jonathan Royston, of
Banbury—where the cakes come from—well, he often reproaches me with being what he calls
rather wild and fast and flighty—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. The only fault I find with Josephine, dear
child. She is so giddy, so thoughtless, so excitable! What a capital match you’d make! Ha,
ha, ha!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). That’s a pretty broad hint!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) And he—I mean Jonathan—says that the best thing I could do would be to get
<i>married!</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. The very conclusion I have come to about
Josephine.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). It really looks as if she wanted
to turn me over to her sister. (<i>Aloud.</i>) And having received the flattering
assurance that my pretensions to your hand might possibly not be unsuccessful—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. From whom, pray? Doubtless from my aunt.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Oh no! From my dear old friend, Barton.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Mr. Barton? He? No, no! I
cannot, <i>will</i> not believe it!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. I’m sure he will not deny it—and see,
fortunately, he’s here!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i> at door <span
class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.</i></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Miss Templeton, your presence is required in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>very coldly, and seating herself at
table</i>). Presently.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside to </i>R<span
class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span>). Well, what news?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). All right! At least, if it isn’t
this one, it’ll be the other! One of the two!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. What do you mean by “the other?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. The “little, harmless, insignificant
school-girl,” you know!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside</i>). Confound the fellow!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. You first put the notion of marriage into my
head, and I won’t leave this house a bachelor; I’ll marry somebody! I leave you together!
You’ll plead my cause, won’t you?—and pitch it strong, won’t you? I shall be all anxiety
to know the result—because if <i>she</i> won’t have me, I can fall back on the other.
Don’t you see? (<i>shaking </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand, and runs out at <span
class="stage">C</span>.</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside, and looking at </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>). To have to plead the cause of another, when, in spite of
me, her presence <i>will</i> recall the past, painful, humiliating as it is!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>with indifference</i>). Your friend has left
you, Mr. Barton?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. He has, <i>Miss Templeton;</i> but he has left
an advocate to intercede with you on his behalf.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>satirically</i>). A willing and an earnest
one, no doubt, who probably has already furnished him with a detailed catalogue of my
tastes, habits, pursuits, disposition—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside</i>). He’s been blabbing!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Surely he cannot have betrayed my confidence?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>with suppressed anger</i>). The charge of
“betrayal of confidence” should rather be levelled at one who by his intimacy with a
family, into which he is admitted on terms of friendship, is enabled to study the
characters of its members for the purpose of retailing the result of his observations to
others!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I will not affect to misunderstand your reproof.
It is true that I spoke of you to Mr. Royston in terms which you fully merit—that I even
told him your heart was free.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Perfectly, absolutely free! You undertook to be
his advocate with such zeal, such earnestness, one might almost imagine you had some
personal interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. And what if I <i>had</i> an interest—a
<i>powerful</i> interest?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Indeed?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes. And after the somewhat harsh rejection I
met with at your hands—which, no doubt, I fully merited—what greater proof can I give of
the esteem in which I still hold you than to confide my secret to you?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>starting</i>). A secret? (<i>Aside.</i>)
What can he mean?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. That, on the eve of leaving your family, I
should feel far less regret could I but indulge in the hope of ever becoming connected
with it by a closer tie.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>aside, and joyfully</i>). Can it be? Has he
forgotten—forgiven? Can he still care for me? (<i>Aloud.</i>) But why this silence—this
want of confidence in me?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Frankly, because we feared you would oppose our
wishes, our hopes.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). <i>Our</i> hopes? <i>We</i>
feared?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes! She especially.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. <i>She?</i> Of whom are you speaking? Her
name?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Surely I must have mentioned it? Your
sister.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>starting from her chair</i>). Josephine!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes; rejected by her elder sister, I sought and
found solace and consolation in her goodness and sympathy.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>with increasing anger</i>). So! Your
frequent visits, your constant presence here, apparently so inconsistent with your
“wounded feelings” (<i>satirically</i>), are now explained! It was for <i>her!</i> And
<i>I</i> was to be kept in ignorance—to fancy, to believe, to hope—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>surprised</i>). Miss Templeton!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. I now understand this anxiety to dispose of my
hand—this crowd of admirers thrown in my way! What mattered <i>my</i> feelings—<i>my</i>
happiness? I was an obstacle to be removed! (<i>with increasing excitement</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I implore you—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>stamping her foot</i>). Silence, sir!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T<span

class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. What is the matter here? Julia! what means
this excitement—this agitation? Perhaps you, sir (<i>to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>)—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I am as much surprised as yourself, madam! I
ventured to confide to Miss Julia my pretensions to the hand of her sister—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>with a scream</i>). What! You had the
<i>cruelty,</i> the <i>barbarity</i> to make such an avowal to her elder sister?
(<i>advancing upon </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>,<i> who retreats</i>)—to
lacerate her feelings! to wound her pride!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. Yes, that’s it!—to wound my pride!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. But really—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Silence, young man! I remember what <i>my</i>
feelings were when my younger sister was married before me. I was choking, sir!
suffocating, sir! I turned positively purple! all sorts of colors, sir! And here is a
little pert, forward chit, daring to follow her Aunt Dorothy Jane’s example!—but here she
comes. (<i>Enter </i>C<span class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span><i> from <span

class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>), a pretty account I’ve heard of you! To mix yourself
up at <i>your</i> age in a silly romance—a nonsensical love-intrigue—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>interfering</i>). But, my dear Martha—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>turning sharply on him</i>). Hold

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. But, aunt, if you’ll only allow me—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. But I <i>won’t</i> allow you! (<i>To
</i>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>.) Keep up your spirits, poor persecuted
victim!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Victim? It seems to me that <i>I’m</i> the
victim! Just as I thought I was going to be married and settled! (<i>beginning to sob;
</i>C<span class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span><i> tries to pacify her</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Married and settled, indeed! A child—a baby
like you! (<i>To </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>.) After what has occurred,
sir, you will see that your further presence under this roof—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>bowing</i>). I fully understand, madam!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>to </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>). Come, miss, follow me! (J<span
class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span><i> about to speak.</i>) Not a word! It is for

(<i>making </i>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span><i> pass before her; she and
</i>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span><i> follow her out at <span

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Wheugh! here’s a pretty piece of business!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Not satisfied with rejecting me herself, she
carries her prejudice, her hate so far as to—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Hate? nonsense! (<i>Suddenly.</i>) By Jove! I
have it!—at least I think I have. What if she should feel a “sneaking kindness” for you,
after all?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Pshaw!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. But what about friend Royston?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Hang friend Royston!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. With all my heart; but where the deuce is he?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Waiting somewhere or other to hear the result of
my interview with Miss Templeton.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. In which you undertook to plead his cause—eh?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes; and forgot all about it in my anxiety to
plead my own!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. What’s that? Do you mean to say you confided to
her the secret between you and Josephine?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes; trusting in her generous nature and her
sisterly affection, I certainly <i>did!</i></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. And a pretty mess you’ve made of it! Well, I must
find Royston and let him know. As for you, as you’ve received orders to march, the sooner
you pack up and pack off the better! (<i>hurries out at <span
class="stage">C</span>.</i>).</p>

<p class="entrance">(<i>Door at <span class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Harry! Are you alone?—quite alone?
(<i>hurries forward</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Such a discovery! (<i>in a very mysterious
tone</i>). She’s got one!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. She? Who?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Julia!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Got one? Got what?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. A young man! shut up in a box!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. In a box?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Listen. After being well scolded by Aunt
Martha, I followed Julia to her room. There she was, with a little open box before her,
out of which she took something, looked at it, then pressed her lips to it, and gave such
a sigh!—you might have heard it here! perhaps you did?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Well?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Then aunt called her, and she hurried out
of the room, leaving the box on the table; and then—then—somehow or other—here it is!
(<i>producing a small casket</i>). It looks as if there was a young man inside—I mean a
portrait—doesn’t it?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. You’ve not opened it? (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. No! That’s for Aunt Martha to do!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Surely you would not betray your sister’s
secret—perhaps her happiness?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Much she cared about <i>mine,</i> didn’t
she? Aunt Martha must and shall see it! (<i>going; </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span><i> stops her, the box falls on stage and opens</i>).
There! there! how clumsy you are!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>picks up the box, and then suddenly
starting</i>). What do I see?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. That’s what I want to know! It <i>is</i> a
portrait, isn’t it?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>confused</i>). Yes!—no! a mere fancy sketch,
nothing more! (<i>taking miniature from box, and hastily concealing it in his
breast-pocket</i>). Be persuaded by me! replace the box where you found it! (<i>giving box
to her</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Mayn’t I take just one little peep?—not
that I’ve an atom of curiosity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>watching her out, then taking miniature out

memory.” What am I to think? Can I dare to hope that her indifference was assumed—that she
ever loved me—that she loves me still? Can such happiness be mine? Dear, dear Julia. But
zounds! what about Josephine? Poor little girl! I can’t marry them both! What—what is to
be done? (<i>walking up and down</i>). Will anybody tell me what’s to be done?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>impatiently</i>). Don’t worry! don’t

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>astonished</i>). Bother! when I want to

despair of becoming one of it!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. What?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. In a word, I’m in love! There’s no mistake about
it! Over head and ears in love!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. What, sir? you persist in carrying on this
absurd, ridiculous joke?</p>

not permit you to annoy poor dear Julia—I mean Miss Templeton—with your unwelcome
attentions, sir—your absurd importunities, sir?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Miss Templeton? My dear fellow, she’s nothing
whatever to do with it! It’s the other! the little one!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>stopping on seeing </i>R<span

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>assuming a very lackadaisical look</i>).
This sort of thing! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Miss Josephine—I—I— (<i>Aside.</i>) It’s very awkward!
if I only knew how to begin.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside to him</i>). Go on!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Pardon my frankness, but it has been impossible
for me to find myself in your charming society without being captivated—enchanted—by your
fascinations, your—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>surprised</i>). I thought it was my
sister who—</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. So it was! but she wouldn’t have me! that’s why
I—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>hastily aside to him</i>). No! that won’t
do!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>shouting</i>). No! that won’t do!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. (<i>still more astonished</i>). And you
don’t hesitate to address me in this language before— (<i>pointing to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>).</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Before my friend—my bosom friend—that I went to
school with at Bagnigge Wells? Why should I? It is he who encourages me—who tells me to
“go on.” You told me to “go on,” didn’t you?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>with intention, and looking at
</i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>). But has it never occurred to you that you
might have a rival?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. So much the better! I should make it my
immediate business to sweep him off the face of the earth!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>to </i>B<span

calmness, indifference! Have <i>you</i> nothing to say?</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes! Have <i>you</i> nothing?—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside to him</i>). Hold <i>your</i> tongue!
(<i>Aloud, and with affected solemnity.</i>) Ah! who can anticipate events? How little do
we know what a few hours may bring forth!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes! how little do we know!—</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside to him again</i>). Hold your tongue!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) In a word, what if circumstances compel me to leave England for a
considerable time?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. A considerable time?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Yes; for two years at least—possibly more!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Two or three years?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Could I venture to hope that you would submit to
such a tax on your goodness—your patience?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). I should think not,
indeed!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. (<i>aside</i>). She doesn’t love me! Huzza!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) What course is, then, open to me? One—only one: to sacrifice myself to the
happiness of my friend!</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>grasping his hand</i>). Glorious
creature!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. But what about your <i>own</i> happiness?
It isn’t likely you could give me up so quietly without some <i>other</i> reason—some
<i>other</i> motive!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. I have <i>another</i> motive, which for your
sister’s sake you will respect! In a word, that portrait—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Then—then <i>you</i> are her young man,

Yes, Josephine, willingly, gladly! Can I be indifferent to your happiness? (<i>smiling

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span> (<i>aside</i>). How bravely she bears
herself! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And yet, just now, you were so indignant, so angry with me?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>. A momentary caprice, an unworthy jealousy!—but
no more of that. Kiss me, dear sister! (<i>kissing </i>J<span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>impatiently</i>). Josephine, I insist on
your explaining this extraordinary behavior instantly!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Nothing so simple. (<i>To </i>C<span

There’s no necessity for our carrying on this innocent little <i>jest</i> any longer, is
there?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Jest?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPHINE</span>. Yes; this harmless conspiracy to make
everybody happy! Julia dear, it was to test your love for me that I pretended to be so
very anxious to get married, which I wasn’t the least little bit in the world (<i>with a
sly look at </i>R<span class="smallerfont">OYSTON</span>). I mean I wasn’t <i>then!</i> My
fellow-conspirator, Mr. Barton, fearing that your rejection of him might proceed from a
preference for another, joined in the plot, but very unwillingly, for it is you, Julia,
you alone, that he has ever loved; you alone that he loves still!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. What is it I hear?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. The truth, madam! (<i>To </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">ULIA</span>.) May I hope, or must I endure a second refusal!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ULIA</span> (<i>tenderly</i>). I suffered too much from the
first, Harry (<i>giving her hand to </i>B<span class="smallerfont">ARTON</span>).</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. (<i>aside</i>). That’s <i>one</i> couple; but
there’s room for another. (<i>To </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T<span

younger niece, Miss Josephine!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. With all my heart, Mr. Royston; that is,
unless Josephine objects.</p>

<p>R<span class="smallerfont">OYS</span>. Yes. But poor Sophia (<i>sighing</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">ART</span>. Hush! (<i>Aside to </i>J<span

put this portrait back in its place.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">ARTHA</span>. There’s the gate bell beginning. Butcher for
orders, I suppose. (<i>Bell heard again.</i>) I thought so; he’s the most impatient young
man I ever came across! Asked me if I’d marry him only yesterday morning when he called
for orders, and was quite saucy because I hadn’t made up my mind when he brought the meat!
I must go and ask missus. (<i>Exit door <span class="stage">R</span>. </i>J<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. No one to be seen; so much the better.
(<i>Calling off.</i>) Now then, Blunt, come along! take care how you turn the corner;

Nothing broken, I hope. No; I don’t even see a chip!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. That’s a wonder, too, your honor! cups and
saucers is rather a delicate sort of cargo to bring all the way from China.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>looking at watch</i>). Nine o’clock! I wonder
if my dear, excellent old aunt is still indulging in a horizontal position? We reached
town so late last night, I was afraid to disturb the dear old soul. (<i>Looking round
him.</i>) Blunt, it strikes me we shall find our quarters here very comfortable—eh?
(<i>falling into chair and stretching out his legs</i>).</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. I think so too, your honor (<i>imitating
</i>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>,<i> then jumping up again and saluting</i>). Beg
pardon, your honor! but when you say our quarters—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. I <i>mean</i> our quarters! You wouldn’t think
of leaving me, you brute, would you? Haven’t we spent the last ten years of our lives
together—more or less respectably?—and if I <i>have</i> got back to Old England again,
sound in wind and limb, who have I to thank? who but you, you fine faithful old dog you
(<i>laying his hand on </i>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>’<span

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span> (<i>deprecatingly</i>). Oh! oh!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. If <i>you</i> forget a certain sabre cut I
received at the Alma, <i>I</i> don’t.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. Oh! oh! just a little bit of a scratch.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Exactly; a little bit of a scratch that began at
the top of my head and finished at the tip of my nose! I was lying on my back faint and
sick, when a noble, lion-hearted fellow cut his way through the Russian cavalry at the
risk of his life, the idiot, threw me across his horse, and saved me! That noble,
lion-hearted idiot was Stephen Blunt—bless him! But enough of the past! By-the-bye, Blunt,
as long as you are stationed here you must make it a point of finding everybody and
everything about you charming, delightful—in short, first chop!</p>

the world for ten years, you don’t know how happy a fellow feels in getting back to his
aunt and having his cheeks pulled about. By-the-bye, aunt, what d’ye think?—what with my
prize-money, the sale of my commission, and one thing and the other, I find I’ve managed
to scrape together a matter of £10,000.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Ten thousand? that’s a large sum of money, my
dear.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. An awful lot, isn’t it? the puzzle is, what I’m
to do with it.</p>

to the land, and the land will stick to you.”</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. I know <i>mud</i> will—at least it did in the
Crimea.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. My dear Jack, do be serious! Now that you are
worth £500 a year—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Five hundred a year! I shall never spend the
half of it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Then get a <i>wife</i> to help you.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. A wife! me? what for?—why, my dear aunt, here
are no end of clever people complaining of the over-population of the country, and you
want me to— (<i>Shaking his head.</i>) No, no!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Eh? what? little Jessie!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>taking both </i>J<span

(<i>measuring about a foot</i>). Why, I used to teach you A B C, didn’t I? And now I
suppose you’re quite an accomplished young lady?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Tolerably so, I hope, cousin.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Then you deserve a prize; and here it is
(<i>opening box on table, takes out a fan and presents it to </i>J<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Oh, what a beautiful Chinese fan! Oh, thank

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Think of you! Do you remember this? (<i>taking

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. My photograph?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Which you gave me the night before I left
England. You’ve never left me! You’ve shared all my hardships, all my dangers, all my
triumphs! Didn’t we enter Pekin together, sword in hand?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>smiling</i>). <i>I</i> enter Pekin!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Yes; rolled up in three of my flannel waistcoats

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Oh, Cousin Jack, I do so long to hear all your
adventures.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Then you shall have them; not all at once;
mustn’t be greedy, little girl. Now for it. (<i>They seat themselves.</i>) Ahem! (<i>in an
impressive tone</i>). In order to make a first-rate brick—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. <i>and</i> J<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Don’t interrupt me! I repeat, in order to make a
first-rate brick they put it on the kiln and bake it. Well, in order to make a first-rate
soldier they send him to India and bake <i>him</i>—that was my case.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Well, from India you went to the Crimea?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Yes; there I took to rum, diluted with snowballs
and gunpowder.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Poor Cousin! how you must have suffered!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Tolerably; but we ate well—when we’d got
anything to eat—and slept well when we hadn’t to keep awake.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. And you were never wounded?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Nothing to speak of. I got rather a warm one at
the Alma, but luckily it was on the head.</p>

My nephew, Captain Pepperpot—Doctor Jogtrot (J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span><i>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. I merely precede my esteemed young friend Mr.

for the hand of this charming young lady (<i>bowing to </i>J<span

stand much more of Jogtrot! I feel I sha’n’t.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. No doubt I shall grieve to part with Jessie;
but as my nephew has left the army, I shall not be entirely alone.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>to </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">ACK</span>). You are a military man, sir?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>who has been showing a gradual
irritation</i>). I <i>was</i>—till I left the army.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. Left the army? Allow me to congratulate you
on your having done so, sir!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>trying to keep cool</i>). May I ask
<i>why?</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>in a supercilious tone</i>). Because,
between ourselves, sir, I consider the military profession—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>bristling up</i>). Well, sir, what about the
military profession? Anything to say <i>against</i> the military profession? (<i>advancing
on </i>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>,<i> who retreats</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>aside to </i>J<span

the siege of Sebastopol now!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>overhearing them, eagerly</i>). The siege
of Sebastopol?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Yes, doctor, my nephew was there during the
whole campaign!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>to </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">ACK</span>). Now, sir, it may be in your power to furnish me with the
most interesting statistical information. Can you form any tolerable accurate estimate of
the number of projectiles of various kinds and dimensions discharged from the Russian
batteries from the beginning of the siege to the end?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Frankly, my dear sir, I’m ashamed to say I never
thought of counting them. (<i>Aside to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. But to return to Mr. Chirper.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Exactly!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. My answer, madam, will be brief! I presented
Mr. Chirper as a candidate for the hand of your niece, and, <i>my</i> word, you received
him graciously. I cannot, therefore, become an accomplice in your inconsistency, not to
say <i>caprice!</i></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. To the nearest hotel hereabouts, ma’am.
Master’s off directly, and I’m going with him!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Oh, then you bear him no malice?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. Malice—me! What for, ma’am?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Pshaw!—in a word, I know what has lately taken
place between you.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Yes! the fisti—fisti—you know (<i>with a lame
imitation of sparring</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>with intention</i>). And we also know the
<i>cause!</i></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. Do you? and do you think I’d leave the captain
just because of a little—little bit of a—kicking?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. What? Then it wasn’t about—her?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span> (<i>surprised</i>). Her?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Yes. M—Martha!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. What! me and master fall out about a petticoat?
Ha! ha! Not we! I suppose I had offended him somehow or other, and he got into one of his
“little pets,” and—struck me—<i>not</i> with his hand, ma’am. It nearly broke my heart. He
saw it, and, like a true gentleman as he is, he asks me, with almost tears in his eyes, to
give him a good hiding, and we sets at it at once then and there; and that’s all about it,
ma’am.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>suddenly</i>). Take that luggage away. Not
a word. Remember, I am commanding officer here! (B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span><i>
makes a salute</i>). In the mean time I’ll see your master.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Yes, we’ll see your master.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. Do please, ladies; and if you’d only try just
to cheer him up a bit.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Is he unhappy, then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. All I know is, as he was ramming his things
into his portmanteau with his fists—this sort of thing (<i>imitating</i>).—I saw a great
big one hanging to the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. A great big what? Not a tear?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LUNT</span>. Yes, miss! he said it was a cold in his head,

hanging to the tip of his great big nose—I mean, a great big tear! Why, <i>why</i> did you
let me tell my guardian that I’d never marry Jack? <i>Do</i> run after him, and tell him
I’ve changed my mind, and that I’ll <i>never,</i> never, never marry any one else.

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>stops on seeing </i>J<span

to find my aunt.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>archly</i>). And you are disappointed at
finding only <i>me?</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>aside</i>). What unseemly levity!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I cannot leave her roof without wishing her good-by.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Of course not—but you’re not going?
(<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>assuming a very dignified manner</i>). I beg

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>imitating </i>J<span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Of course; how <i>can</i> I get married unless
you <i>do</i> remain?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). You don’t expect me to give
Dicky away, I hope?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. No; but I certainly <i>do</i> expect you will
give yourself away! and to me who love you, oh, so dearly!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>throwing away his coat, etc., and clasping
</i>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span><i> in his arms</i>). Jessie darling! But
what—what does it all mean?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>very rapidly</i>). That I know <i>why</i>
you got fisti—fisti—you know—with your servant; that it wasn’t about Martha at all; that
all my guardian said about you was a great big story!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Oh! oh! So old Jogtrot has been poking his ugly
nose into my affairs again, has he? (<i>Savagely.</i>) I’ll wring it off!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>holding up her finger</i>). Now listen to
me, Cousin Jack; if you cannot and do not control that dreadfully peppery temper of
yours—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). But I <i>will!</i> I swear
it by—by this (<i>taking small hand-bell off table</i>). Now, Jessie, if ever you see me
getting the least little bit frantic, you’ve only to—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. I understand (<i>taking bell and ringing
it</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. That’s it!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>looking towards <span

(<i>pointing; </i>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span><i> moves a few paces from

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. This sort of thing? (<i>putting on a sulky

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Worse than that (J<span

your back to me (J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span><i> obeys; </i>J<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>in a soothing tone</i>). Cheer up, my
gallant young friend; the sex, you know, is capricious—“sipping each flower, changing each
hour.” It is sad—very sad!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). For <i>me,</i> not for
<i>you,</i> who have always opposed my marriage with my cousin.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. I? On the contrary, not ten minutes ago I
asked her if she had any lingering affection for you, and her answer was—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. That I would marry Mr. Chirper.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. There, there! you hear?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>. Yes, but (<i>imitating </i>J<span

flower, changing each hour.” So now, Guardy, I’ll marry Jack, please (<i>bobbing a
courtesy; then running to </i>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>,<i> who takes her in
his arms</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>shouting</i>). Stop! that’s all wrong

class="smallerfont">ARLETAN</span><i> and </i>C<span class="smallerfont">HIRPER</span>,<i>

gigantic, a colossal mistake here!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. (<i>smiling</i>). A mistake? Not at all!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. Not at all! Am I to understand, then, madam,
that after the deplorable—scandalous scene of this morning—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Which has been fully explained, and will never
be repeated!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. Never! I’ve sworn it (<i>looking at </i>J<span

more tempers, no more “little pets.”</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>aside</i>). One more chance!

his shoulders and giving a deep sigh</i>).</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>bristling up sharply.</i>) What’s that?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>sneeringly</i>). I believe, sir, I have
already expressed my opinion of military men—as <i>husbands!</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>threateningly</i>). Take my advice, sir, and
leave military men alone, or else— (J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span><i> takes small
bell and rings it; </i>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span><i> falls into chair
laughing.</i>)</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. In a word—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. T. Pardon me, doctor, you have said quite enough

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>indignantly</i>) <i>More</i> than enough,
Doctor Jogtrot! (<i>advancing on </i>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>,<i> who
retreats; she follows him up</i>). For the last ten minutes you’ve been insulting a better
man than yourself, Doctor Jogtrot!—a <i>far</i> better man, Doctor Jogtrot!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>aside</i>). Halloa! here’s J<span
class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> getting into a pet! (<i>takes second small bell and rings
it; </i>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span><i> and </i>J<span

bells, </i>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span><i> staring at them in
astonishment</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">HIRPER</span> (<i>to </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>,<i> in a sympathizing tone</i>). My dear respected
friend—</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span> (<i>turning fiercely on </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">HIRPER</span>). And you! standing there like a gaping idiot—ugh!</p>

you, Dicky?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">HIRPER</span>. <i>And</i> the Philotechnic, where,
by-the-bye, I am now due.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OGTROT</span>. So am I. Come along (<i>slams his hat on his
head, puts his arm in </i>C<span class="smallerfont">HIRPER</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span>,<i> swings him round, and drags him out at <span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span> (<i>taking </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand</i>). Mine!
mine at last!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ESSIE</span> (<i>smiling</i>). But remember. Jack, no more
irritability, no more tempers.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">ACK</span>. No! Here, here I vow, protest, and declare is
the last of Pepperpot’s little <i>Pets!</i> (<i>kisses </i>J<span

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>D<span class="smallerfont">R</span>. P<span

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPH</span> (<i>to </i>M<span

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> (<i>coming down</i>). Do what you are doing
now!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPH</span>. I ain’t doing nothing, sir.</p>

best thing you <i>can</i> do.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPH</span>. But I shall catch it from <i>both</i> my
missusses, sir!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. At first perhaps you <i>will;</i> but when
they find they’ve both fared alike, they’ll each feel secretly flattered by the
inattention you show to the other. Go to your work.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OSEPH</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Exit at <span class="stage">C</span>.</i></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Well, friend Jeremiah!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Well, friend Vicessimus!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. I seem to have dropped in at rather an unlucky
moment; but frankly, if I were to wait till your domestic barometer pointed to “calm and
settled” weather, I’m afraid my visits wouldn’t be very frequent.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. True, my dear doctor.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. I don’t know how you manage it, but you
generally contrive to have a thunder-storm, more or less violent, rumbling over this house
of yours.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. True again, and I’ll tell you why. Because this
“house of mine,” as you call it, is constantly exposed to two discordant elements from
opposite directions, but invariably coming into contact and exploding <i>here!</i></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. I don’t exactly understand.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. It’s very simple. Living here with my mother
and my wife, who <i>both</i> claim to be “monarch of all they survey,” I, the master of
the house—</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Find yourself cutting rather a contemptible
figure—eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Very much so. It would be easy enough to do as
Georgina wishes, <i>or</i> my mother, but to do as they <i>both</i> wish is impossible,
for the simple reason that no two women ever wish the same thing, <i>consequently,</i> the
result is anger on one side, sulky looks on the other; one invokes her title of “mother,”
the other her privileges of “wife;” consequently, between the two—</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. You come in for more kicks than
half-pence?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Considerably more! In fact, <i>all</i>
kicks.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. And yet I don’t know a more charming, amiable
person than your excellent mother. I’ve known and admired her for more than thirty years;
in fact, had it depended on me, I might very possibly have been your father.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Thank you. But I’m very well satisfied as I am;
besides, the thing couldn’t be done now.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Not conveniently! However, she preferred
marrying the “author of your being,” so there was an end of my romance! But to return to
these unfortunate domestic quarrels; from what I know of your mother, I am convinced the
fault lies with your wife.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. And from what I know of my wife, I’m certain it
lies with my mother.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Then, my good friend, why not at once put an
end to these personal and conjugal troubles of yours?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. How?</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Simply thus. Appoint one of the two contending
parties—no matter which—to the sole control of your domestic affairs; support her
authority through thick and thin, give her credit for always being right, even when she’s
wrong, and the thing’s done!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. A very good plan, I dare say, but, unluckily,
it’s impracticable.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Why?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Because it would require a considerable amount
of <i>pluck</i> to carry it out, and I hain’t got an atom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Nonsense! You’ve only to show a proper
spirit.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. How can I do that when I hain’t any spirit
<i>at all?</i></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Pshaw! Recollect, Nero was a perfect lamb at
starting, and yet he fiddled when Rome was burning.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. But I’m not a Nero! Besides, I hain’t got a
fiddle, and I couldn’t fiddle if I had.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Here they both come! Do as I tell you, pluck
up a proper spirit; in the mean time I’ll beat a retreat (<i>runs out at <span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>shouting after him</i>). Coward! to leave me

absolutely unbearable! (<i>entering hurriedly at <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. To take no notice of my bell!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. What’s
the use of my ringing?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh! here you are, son Jeremiah.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Yes, my dear mother; (<i>aside</i>) and I
devoutly wish I was anywhere else!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>turning him round towards her</i>). I
appeal to you to see that my authority in this house is respected!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>with pretended surprise</i>). What! Has any
one dared—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>
(<i>turning him towards her</i>). I presume you won’t allow <i>me</i> to be treated with
inattention?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. (<i>with pretended surprise again</i>). What!
Has any one presumed—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>aside to him</i>). But what’s the matter
with your wife? She seems out of temper!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Yes! because Joseph didn’t attend to her
summons at once. When <i>you</i> require him, he knows better than to do <i>that!</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>aside

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. No wonder! Joseph didn’t answer her bell. He
knows better than keep <i>you</i> waiting. (<i>Aside.</i>) What a humbug I am!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. By-the-bye, Jeremiah, I have ordered dinner an
hour later to-day.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Indeed?
and for what reason, pray?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Because it suits me.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Oh! of course, my dear Georgina, if it suits
her—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. But it
doesn’t suit <i>me.</i> I expect Mr. Simcox, the jeweller, early this evening, and cannot

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Oh! of course, my dear mother, if she expects
Mr. Simcox—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. What can have brought her back?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>heard speaking off at <span

such a beauty too! (<i>runs in at <span class="stage">C</span>.; she is in a light summer
travelling costume</i>). Here I am! How astonished you all look! Ha! ha! ha! (<i>Running
to </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> P.)
Dear Georgina! so glad to see you once again (<i>kissing her—Nodding to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>). How do, brother Jeremiah? and you, dear mamma? (<i>about
to kiss </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P<span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>stiffly</i>). I was not aware, miss, that
it was usual for a well-educated young lady to address her sister-in-law before her
mother!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Did I? So sorry, dear mamma. I really didn’t
see you at first.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>aside</i>). I’m sure she’s big enough!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>holding up her face to </i>M<span

know you’re punishing yourself as well as me.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Who can resist the dear child? (<i>kissing
</i>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>). But we thought your visit to your Cheltenham
friends was intended to last another week?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. So it was, but they were obliged to return to
town, so they brought me with them, put my luggage into a cab at the station, me on the
top—I mean my luggage on the top—and here I am!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Very well, Joseph. (<i>Aside to </i>M<span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>aside to her</i>). All right; six o’clock,

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>aside

dinner-hour!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>aside to her</i>). All right; five o’clock,
sharp! (<i>Aside.</i>) Between the two the chances are I sha’n’t get any dinner at
all!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I’m so glad we’re alone at last, Georgina; we
can have a nice long chat together all alone; and I’ve such a lot to tell you!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Well, I’m
all attention! But first, how did you enjoy your trip to Cheltenham?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Not much. I found it rather slow. Nothing but a
collection of bilious-looking fogies being wheeled about in Bath-chairs. But never mind
that; I’ve something else to talk about!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>
(<i>smiling</i>). Something very serious, no doubt.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Awfully serious! Listen! At the very first ball
I went to at the Assembly-rooms—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. A very
brilliant affair, of course!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Really, Georgina, if you keep on interrupting
me in this sort of way—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. I beg
your pardon! Well?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Well, at my very first ball I danced with a
gentleman once or twice—perhaps three or four times.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Young, of
course (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Rather!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>.
Handsome?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). Very! Well, judge of my
surprise when, the very next morning, as I was sitting in the drawing-room, the door
opened and the servant announced “Captain Boodle!”</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. The
“young gentleman?” (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Perhaps
you had given him your address?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Not I, indeed! He didn’t
ask for it, or perhaps I might! Well, the next morning he called again, and the following
morning, and the morning after that—in short, every morning—and as I was always in the
drawing-room, of course quite by accident—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. You
naturally became quite intimate—familiar and chatty.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. <i>He</i> didn’t. <i>I</i> did all the
<i>chatting</i> part! Never did I see any one so timid, so bashful, as Boodle. When he
<i>did</i> try to say something, there he’d stand stammering and stuttering and blushing
like a school-girl! But although his tongue didn’t say much, his <i>eyes</i> did!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>
(<i>smiling</i>). And they said, “I love you?”</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Distinctly! Well, I thought to myself it’s not
a bit of use going on like this. It’s quite evident the poor man<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-92">[Pg 92]</a></span> worships the very ground I tread upon. So
when he called next day, and I told him, in <i>tremulous accents,</i> of course, that I
was going away, the effect was magical. First he turned pale, then red, then blue; then he
let his hat fall, then his umbrella, then himself—on both his knees, at both my feet, and
there, I believe, he would have remained till further notice, if I hadn’t said to him,
“Augustus”—his name is Augustus—“I won’t pretend to misunderstand you. You love me! I am
yours!”</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. What!
Such an act of thoughtlessness, of indiscretion, on your part!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Perhaps it was, but I know this: it quite cured
him of his timidity; for when he once <i>did</i> begin, I never heard anybody’s tongue
rattle on at such a rate as his did—never!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. And the
result, I presume, was—</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. That we both, then and there, exchanged vows of
constancy and locks of hair! His is rather red, by-the-bye! But I see mamma coming!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Then I’ll
retire. Seeing us closeted together would only arouse her ridiculous jealousy.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. And I’ll see if I can’t find an opportunity to
slip in a word about Augustus. In the mean time you’ll keep my secret?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>.
Religiously! for your sake (<i>going up</i>).</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. And Boodle’s.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>
(<i>turning and smiling</i>). And Boodle’s.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I have something serious to say to you,
Fanny.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. So have I to you, mamma—<i>very</i>
serious!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Indeed! In the mean time, as I happen to be
your mother, and you, consequently, happen to be my daughter, perhaps you’ll allow me to
begin <i>first?</i></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Then listen. Although you are still very
young—</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Nineteen next birthday, mamma.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Don’t interrupt me! Although you are still
young, I have been reflecting a good deal lately on that all-important subject, your
future settlement in life!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>quickly</i>). So have I, mamma!
(<i>Aside.</i>) I shall be able to get in a word presently about Augustus!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. In other words, don’t you consider it high
time you thought of matrimony?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). I <i>do,</i> mamma! I’m
always thinking of it!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. But of course it isn’t likely <i>you</i> can
have any one in your eye <i>yet!</i></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I beg your pardon! I <i>have!</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>severely</i>). What’s that you say?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. That is—I mean—of course I hain’t!
(<i>Aside.</i>) It won’t do to say anything about Augustus yet; I must keep him dark!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Then you have no positive antipathy to the
married state?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I should think not, indeed! (<i>very
quickly</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>severely</i>). My dear, I’m really
surprised to hear a<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-94">[Pg
94]</a></span> well-educated young lady express herself in such, I might almost say
indelicate, terms. But to return; I need not say I would not encourage any candidate for
your hand who was not deserving of you.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Of course not, mamma! He <i>must</i> be worthy
of such a treasure!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Tolerably young, and not absolutely
ill-looking!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Certainly not! (<i>Aside.</i>)
I call Augustus decidedly <i>good-</i>looking!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. And in the possession of ample means.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>aside</i>). Augustus has got ever so much
already, besides two rich maiden aunts and an aged godmother!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. All of which qualifications are, fortunately,
in the possession of Sir Marmaduke Mangle!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Sir Marmaduke Mangle? Lor, mamma, you can’t
mean that little old man we met at Brighton, with a bad cough, a wig, and a canary-colored
complexion?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. He’s not old by any means, and is only
<i>slightly</i> canary-colored after all! However, he has seen you, he admires you, and
offers you his hand, his heart, his title, and his fortune!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. But I don’t love <i>him,</i> mamma! I never
<i>could</i> love him—even if I didn’t love somebody else!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>starting</i>). What’s that I hear? You
love somebody else?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes, and one who loves <i>me,</i> and one I’m
determined to marry, or die an old maid. There!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>angrily</i>). Silence, miss!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). I won’t silence! If you
think Sir Marmaduke such a very great catch, marry him yourself! I’ll consent to it, and
give you away into the bargain! It’s quite evident you were never in love!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I beg your pardon! I <i>was,</i> intensely,

sigh</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Nevertheless, I married your father—and we were not so <i>very</i> unhappy, considering!
(<i>To </i>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>,<i> who is about to speak.</i>) Not

is, I have made a work-room of it for myself; besides, Fanny’s proper place is with her

I only hear my mother in the day, whereas my wife—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>to </i>M<span

which of the two?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span> (<i>after a violent effort</i>). My wife! There!
I’ve said it. (F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span><i> whispers him.</i>) Confound
it!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Ah! (<i>screaming and falling into a
chair</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Come,

So! she—<i>she’s</i> to be everybody, and <i>I’m</i> to be nobody! a cipher, a nonentity!
Was there ever such ingratitude? I, who left my own home to live with them, without even

entire control of their domestic affairs—nay, even to carry my maternal affection so far
as not to allow either of them to interfere in anything whatever!</p>

that’s the very reason why everything went wrong.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. But I’ll forget them, I’ll renounce them, I’ll

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Mercy on us! here’s a pretty piece of business!
Live with me when I am married! Poor Augustus! he little suspects what a rod there is in

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> (<i>without</i>). In the parlor, is she? Very
well!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Surely that’s dear Doctor Prettywell’s

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span><i> at <span

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Ah! my dear young friend, delighted to see
you!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Not more than I am to see you, doctor!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. But let me look at you. How we’re grown! I
declare we’re quite a young woman!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes, doctor.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. And a very pretty one, too!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes, doctor.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> (<i>looking intently at </i>F<span
class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>). She’s the very image of her mother as she <i>was</i>
thirty years ago; the same soft blue eyes, before she took to spectacles, the same fairy
form, before it filled out, the same alabaster brow, before the wrinkles set in!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>aside</i>). How earnestly he looks at me! I
hope I hain’t fascinated <i>him</i> as well as Sir Marmaduke! (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Goodness
me! what if <i>he</i> should be the “youthful doctor” mamma was speaking about? (D<span
class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span><i> looks at her again and gives a loud sigh.</i>) What a
sigh! It must be he. He may still have some lingering affection for her; the flame may not
be <i>quite</i> burnt out; there may be a tiny spark left which a little gentle
<i>blowing</i> may rekindle into a blaze. It isn’t very likely; still, I may as well try
what a little “blowing” may do.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Well, now that your education is completed,
and you’ve come home brimful of accomplishments, of course you’ll go into society, and,
like other young ladies, pick up a husband?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>with affected indifference</i>). A husband?
Not I, indeed! I’ve never even thought of such a thing! (<i>Aside.</i>) I had no idea I
could fib so well! (<i>Aloud.</i>) No, doctor! I’ve too much regard for my own
tranquillity, my own peace of mind!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Hoity-toity! Who’s been putting such nonsense
into your head?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Why, you yourself never ventured on
matrimony!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. No! because I—I— Heigh-ho! (<i>giving a loud
sigh</i>).</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>aside, and smiling</i>). The “tiny spark” is
gradually getting into a blaze! I did quite right in trying the effect of a little
“<i>blowing!</i>” (<i>Aloud.</i>) Besides, I have come to the conclusion, from
considerable personal experience, that the male sex in general—I mean, taken in a
<i>lump</i>—is no better than it should be.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Indeed!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I’m sorry to say they’re a false, fickle,
perfidious <i>lot!</i> They gain a poor confiding woman’s heart only to trifle with it and
trample on it! Poor dear mamma! I am no longer surprised at your little fits of temper—at
your discontent with everything and everybody—now that I know the sad circumstances which
blighted your youth and cast a gloom over your after-life! (<i>with affected
pathos</i>).</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> (<i>aside</i>). What do I hear? (<i>Aloud, and
anxiously.</i>) Has your mother, then, revealed?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. No; but she might just as well, because I was
sure to find it out.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Find out <i>what?</i></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. A lot of things! Ah, doctor! if you had only
heard her sigh as I have!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Sigh?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes; but that’s not all. Poor mamma! You’d
hardly believe the number of pearly drops I’ve seen fall from her poor eyes into her
teacup.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Pearly drops?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. But <i>that’s</i> not all! (<i>In a very
mysterious manner.</i>) I<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-99">[Pg

accents, “Ah! if he had really loved me, would he not have declared his passion when I
became a widow?”</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Did she? (<i>Aside.</i>) She loves me still!
Dear Cleopatra!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Who can she mean? I should so like to know.
Perhaps, doctor, you’ll help me to find out; but here she comes (<i>looking towards <span

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. Nothing; only a sort of a kind of a—of a—I
scarcely know whether I am standing on my head or my heels!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. On your head, of course!</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. I thought so.</p>

I’ll see if I can’t find one for <i>you!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>aside</i>). I must find out who this
“girlish fancy” of hers is. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Come here, Fanny. Of course <i>your</i>
happiness is all I desire!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. And it’s all <i>I</i> desire too, mamma!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Then have confidence in your mother—your
<i>only</i> mother! Tell me the name of the young man who has won your affections.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. You asked me if I had any one in my eye, and I
said I <i>had,</i> but I didn’t tell you he was a <i>young</i> man. The fact is, mamma,
I’ve been so often told that I am so giddy, so thoughtless, so flighty, that I selected
some one of <i>maturer</i> years; he would give me the benefit of his experience—his
advice—his—his—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Maturer years?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes! Besides, he has known me so long!—ever
since I was a tiny little mite. He used to dandle me on his knee, and buy me dolls and
toys and sweeties and hardbake and elecampane, and all that sort of thing!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>aside</i>). Known her for years!
(<i>Suddenly.</i>) Mercy on us! can she be alluding to “Vicessimus?”</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. But, ma dear, that which attracted more than
all was the respectful, I may say the <i>affectionate,</i> terms in which he always speaks
of <i>you.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Does he? (<i>Aside.</i>) Poor fluttering
heart, be still! Dear Vicessimus! He hain’t, then, quite forgot his Cleopatra!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) But is D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span> P<span
class="smallerfont">RETTYWELL</span>—for it surely must be <i>he</i> to whom your remarks
apply—</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes, mamma.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>aside</i>). I thought so. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Is he aware of your somewhat foolish partiality?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I think so. He’ll tell you why! Whenever he
used to call, and we happened to be sitting side by side—I mean you and I, mamma—I noticed
that he always kept his eye fixed on us, and it always made me blush so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>aside</i>). Poor simple child. She
flatters herself that it was on <i>her</i> that Vicessimus’s enamoured glances were
riveted.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. And don’t you recollect the last time he took
us to the theatre, how attentive, how polite he was to you?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Yes. I remember he brought me three oranges
and an ounce of acidulated drops into our box.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. And if you only had heard him just now, when I
told him how shamefully you had been treated here! “What!” he exclaimed, turning quite red
in the face and tearing his hair out in handfuls. “What! Dare to offer such an affront to
so good, so amiable, so excellent a woman—a woman born to command, born to be
beloved!”</p>

poor little fluttering heart, be still! (<i>Aside, and looking at </i>F<span

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. There! I flatter myself I’ve managed that
rather cleverly. I’ve given tranquillity to Jeremiah, happiness to Georgina; I’ve got

audacious manner, for the last month!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. And at
last he has actually had the effrontery to write to me. A groom called just now with a
letter, and was in the act of giving it to Mary, with strict injunctions to deliver it to
me, and to me only, when my husband suddenly appeared and snatched the letter out of his
hand.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>aside</i>). Something more for me to do! I
shall never get my work done here!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AJOR</span>. Yes! listen, and shudder! (<i>taking letter out
of envelope, which he lets fall on stage, then reading in an impressive tone</i>). “Star
of my life, idol of my heart!” That’s pretty well to begin with! (<i>Reading again.</i>)
“Ever since the God of Love first presented you to my enraptured orbs!” (<i>Aside.</i>)
What does the fellow mean by “orbs?” (<i>Reading again.</i>) “I have loved you”—point of
admiration; here it is, there’s no mistake about the point of admiration! (<i>showing

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. For you?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Yes! although I particularly told him not to
write to me.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Told him? Told <i>who?</i></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. Augustus!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Who’s Augustus?</p>

first met him at Cheltenham!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. So did I.</p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. He was only a lad then, and was going into the
army—to distinguish himself, as he said.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span>. I can’t say whether he did distinguish
<i>himself,</i> but I know that he very soon distinguished <i>me!</i></p>

<p>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>. The Boodles of Gloucestershire. There’s not a
more respected family in the county! Come, my dear Mrs. Pelican, if you’ll take my advice,
you’ll not hesitate in accepting Augustus Noodle—I mean Boodle—as a son-in-law!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Well, I’ll think the matter over, and then,
perhaps, I may say yes.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">ANNY</span> (<i>coaxingly</i>). Suppose you say yes first,
mamma, and think the matter over afterwards?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. (<i>ironically</i>). But, Fanny, what about a

dutiful in a daughter to deprive her mother of the object of her early affection?</p>

</i>D<span class="smallerfont">OCTOR</span>). In a word, I have been induced to accept the

<p class="tp smallfont">[The action is supposed to take place in a first-class
railway-carriage, travelling on a certain line between a certain place and another certain
place.]</p>

<p class="scene">S<span class="smallerfont">CENE</span>.—<i>A plain interior, supposed to
represent a compartment in a first-class railway-carriage; door in flat at <span
class="stage">C</span>.—the entrance—four easy-chairs placed two and two opposite the
others, representing the seats—on the second chair at <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>. an open newspaper.</i></p>

<p><i>The actor playing the part of the gentleman enters at door <span
class="stage">C</span>. in light overcoat, with travelling-bag, hat-box, and railway-rug
over his arm; he places the bag, hat-box, and rug on first chair, <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>., and advances, cap in hand,
and, after sundry bows, proceeds to explain the scene to the audience.</i> Ladies and
gentlemen: The little piece we are about to present to you is supposed to take place in a
first-class compartment of a railway-carriage, travelling express from—from—Plymouth to
London; shall we say Plymouth to London?—very well—Plymouth to London. You will also be
good enough to see in the humble individual who is now addressing you, a
deputy-assistant-deputy-inspector of Government prisons, returning from an official visit
to that well-known and, judging from the constant stream of applications for admission,
highly popular convict establishment at—at—<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Dartmouth; shall we say Dartmouth?—be it so, we’ll say
Dartmouth! Our first idea, in order to impart a greater reality to the situation, was to
place before you a regular train with locomotive, etc., etc., all complete, and for this
purpose we applied to a certain railway company for the loan of one; but the secretary, in
reply, said that the only materials he could offer us were cattle-trucks and coal-wagons,
all the passenger rolling-stock being in requisition, owing to the unusual number they had
smashed up during the year. He certainly offered us the use of an engine, but at the same
time candidly gave us to understand that it was a little bit rusty, and wouldn’t stand the
slightest pressure; he further added that if the knob of the steam-whistle <i>should</i>
happen to knock out the front teeth of any of the audience, we were not to blame
<i>him</i> if we had a few compensation actions to sustain!—and so on! Altogether the
alternative was so dismal that we decided on sacrificing a flaming line in our play-bill
about “flashing express,” “real steam,” “genuine foot-warmers,” which we had composed for
the occasion, and to fall back upon the best scene that our stage-carpenter and
property-man could prepare for us.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, ask you to bring your imaginations to our aid, and to fancy you see
in that door and in these four easy-chairs the interior of a first-class compartment of a
railway-carriage, and to imagine further that I have passed the night in one of them, and
am at the present moment still enjoying a profound sleep.</p>

<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to enter into my part, to seat myself in the
snuggest corner I can find, and to resume my interrupted nap! (<i>makes a profound bow to
audience, goes up stage, and seats himself on the first chair, <span

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>heard without</i>). Reading! Change here for
Guildford, Dorking, Reigate, Redhill!</p>

<p>V<span class="smallerfont">OICE</span> (<i>without</i>). Guard, how long do we stop
here?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>without</i>). Ten minutes, sir! (<i>Cries of
“Reading; change here,” etc., etc., etc., repeated, and gradually diminishing, accompanied
by noise of slamming doors, etc.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>starting from his sleep</i>). What’s
that? Who speaks of stopping? I wonder what the time is? (<i>Looks at watch.</i>) Seven
o’clock? (<i>Opens door and looks out.</i>) Broad daylight, I declare (<i>closing door
again</i>); then I must have slept the best part of the night! I don’t even remember my
travelling companion getting out; he seems to have forgotten his newspaper (<i>taking up
paper from chair</i>). Not a very talkative fellow; in fact, he never opened his mouth,
except to put something into it—principally Abernethys and peppermint-drops. By Jove, his
<i>Daily News</i> is full of crumbs and caraways now!—a regular pantry!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>again heard without</i>). Reading! Ten
minutes to stop!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Ten minutes to stop? Then I may as well get
out and stretch my legs a bit (<i>rises, puts railway-rug, guide, and travelling-bag on
his seat, and goes to door <span class="stage">C</span>.; then calls</i>). Guard,
whereabouts is the refreshment-bar?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>without</i>). This way, sir (G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> goes out at door <span class="stage">C</span>.
towards <span class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.—short
pause</i>).</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>The </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> looks in at <span
class="stage">C</span>. and stops; then enters with two small parcels and a
bonnet-box.</i></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes; all things considered, I decidedly prefer
this carriage to the ladies’ compartment, where there’s only room for one, and then what
should I do with my packages? Besides, ladies are not so <i>remarkably</i> agreeable among
themselves; while here— (<i>looking about her</i>). Let me see, which corner shall I take?
I think this will do (<i>indicating the seat which the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> has</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-109">[Pg 109]</a></span> <i>just left</i>); one’s face to the engine, and not so
likely to be troubled by people getting in and out; yes, this will do very well indeed!
(<i>during this she removes the </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span><i> effects from first chair <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>. to the opposite chair at <span
class="stage">R</span>.</i>) And after all, provided one has a <i>gentleman</i> for a
travelling companion, a host of these little difficulties soon disappear! (<i>Seats
herself on first chair <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>.</i>). There! I shall do very nicely here—very nicely indeed!
(<i>Here the </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> appears outside at door
<span class="stage">C</span>.</i>) Some one’s coming! one of the opposite sex! I
<i>hope</i> a gentleman. Suppose I pretend to be asleep? I will! I’ll shut my eyes, and
then I shall be able to judge of his appearance! (<i>wraps herself up so as to conceal her
face, and pretends to be asleep</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>entering at door and stamping his
feet</i>). I feel all the better! Thanks to a glass of sherry and half a dozen rapid turns
up and down the platform, the circulation is re-established; so now for another dose of
pins and needles. Holloa! what’s this?—my seat taken, and all my things bundled away
anyhow on another seat! Well, of all the cool proceedings— (<i>To the </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span>.) I beg pardon, madam, but— Asleep? Rather a sudden attack
of drowsiness, considering she can’t have been here more than five minutes! However, she’s
a lady—at least she looks like one, though she <i>is</i> such a cool hand, and I can’t be
so ungallant as to turn her out, especially as she looks so snug and comfortable! I must
take another corner! (<i>He seats himself on second chair at <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>., partly turning his back to the
</i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>.)</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside and partly uncovering her face</i>). I
knew these little difficulties would soon arrange themselves! (<i>wraps herself up as
before</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>fidgeting about in his seat</i>). I was
much more comfortable in my own seat. There was a nice hollow for one’s back there; but
here there’s a confounded lump that’s positively painful! I must confess I have found that
women in general haven’t the slightest hesitation in taking advantage of one if they
possibly can. Here’s an instance; just as I had got used to my<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-110">[Pg 110]</a></span> seat, in comes one of the weaker sex and
turns me out bag and baggage! They know their power, and abuse it: too bad! Now
(<i>looking aside at </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>) if my neighbor were but
young—and pretty into the bargain—but no; catch a woman wrapping herself up like that when
she <i>is</i> young (<i>gaping</i>) and pretty! (<i>His head nods once or twice, and he
falls asleep.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>without</i>). Take your seats! Any more
going on?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>cautiously peeping at </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>,<i> then uncovering, and aside</i>). So it seems I
shall have no other travelling companion but this gentleman! (<i>Here loud railway-whistle
heard, and noise of train starting.</i>) We’re off. (<i>Looking at </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> again.</i>) I must say he appears to be perfectly
harmless and inoffensive. (G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> snores.</i>) What
did he say? (<i>A louder snore from </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>). Well,
if that’s a specimen of his conversation, it isn’t likely to compromise one! (<i>Another
snore.</i>) I may as well go to sleep myself, and then, perhaps, I may be able to join in
the <i>conversation</i> too! (<i>Wraps herself up, but this time allows her face to remain
uncovered; closes her eyes; pause.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>suddenly waking and shifting his
position</i>). Decidedly, of all the uncomfortable seats this is the most uncomfortable. I
<i>should</i> like to know what they stuff their cushions with; I feel as if I’d got a
quartern loaf at my back! (<i>Taking a rapid glance at </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span>,<i> then, in a savage tone.</i>) <i>She</i> seems
comfortable enough! How absurd—how ridiculous of me not to have demanded—not to have
in-sis-ted. (<i>Looking again at </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>.) By Jove, she
<i>is</i> young! and by no means bad-looking! Bad-looking! she’s pretty—<i>very</i>
pretty—<i>excessively</i> pretty! and to think I should have actually gone to sleep in her
presence! One never knows what one does in one’s sleep; luckily, I never snore; that’s one
comfort! (<i>Takes off his travelling-cap, arranges his hair, cravat, etc.</i>) How
soundly she sleeps—if she <i>does</i> sleep! (<i>in doubt</i>). When one is <i>really</i>
asleep—I mean <i>fast</i> asleep—it isn’t usual to wear a smile on one’s face; on the
contrary, one’s face generally gets ugly! I’ll be bound that just now I was positively
hideous!<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-111">[Pg 111]</a></span> (<i>He
coughs loudly, the </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> moves.</i>) She wakes!
(<i>Suddenly and loudly.</i>) What a beautiful country! what a lovely green on those
meadows! (L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> keeps silence.</i>) I’ll try again!
(<i>Still louder.</i>) How unusually beautiful are the autumn tints, especially so early
in the spring! (<i>Pause; aside.</i>) No response? She must have taken a sleeping
draught!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>pretending to wake</i>). A thousand pardons,
sir; did you speak?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. I was merely observing what a lovely meadow
on those greens! I mean (<i>another pause</i>) I hear the harvest is likely to be a
plentiful one, although I’m told that turnips are backward; I haven’t heard anything about
carrots.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>in an indifferent tone</i>). I beg pardon;
were you speaking to me? (<i>Aside.</i>) Some gentleman farmer, evidently.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>nettled, and imitating her—aside</i>).
“Were you speaking to me?” I rather think I <i>was</i> speaking to her! Holloa! she’s off
to sleep again! No one can call <i>her</i> particularly wide-awake. Well, since she’s off
into land of dreams again, I don’t see why I shouldn’t indulge in a cigarette (<i>takes
out some cigarette papers, tobacco pouch, spreads them on his knees and proceeds to make a
cigarette; then stops</i>). Stop, though! I can’t smoke without first asking her
permission; of course not! (<i>Aloud, and coughing.</i>) Ahem! (<i>Watching her.</i>)
Sound as a top! Try again! (<i>Coughing louder.</i>) Ahem! (<i>The </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> opens her eyes and moves impatiently—aside.</i>) That
did it!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>apologetically</i>). My cough is rather
troublesome, ma’am.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. I find it so—very!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). Well! that’s about the
rudest thing I’ve heard for some time! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I was about to ask you whether you
object to the smell of tobacco?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Oh, not at all, sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Thank you! (<i>proceeds to make his
cigarette, and about to light it</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. I mean, not till it’s lighted!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Oh, I see; and then you do?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Very much, indeed!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Even when you are asleep? (<i>in an
insinuating tone</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>slowly and decisively</i>). Whether I am
awake <i>or</i> asleep, sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). Now that’s what I call
selfish—just as if the smoke <i>could</i> get up her nose when her eyes are shut!
(<i>putting away his smoking apparatus. Aside</i>). I must say I <i>have</i> met more
agreeable young ladies—<i>very much</i> more agreeable—in fact, I may say I never remember
meeting one <i>less</i> agreeable. Well, I sha’n’t disturb the “Sleeping Beauty” again in
a hurry. Now for another nap! (<i>sulkily crams smoking apparatus into his pocket, draws
his cap very much over his head, stands up, folds himself up in his rug, and then flounces
down on his seat again, partially turning his back to the </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. (<i>slowly turning her head and taking a glance
at </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>). Well, I must confess he put away his
smoking apparatus with a very good grace! (<i>Sees newspaper.</i>) Some one has left a
newspaper! (<i>Taking newspaper and reading.</i>) Um, um! <i>Plymouth Gazette.</i>
“Foreign News,” “Paris Fashions,” “Early Strawberries.” What’s this? “Escape of a convict.
We learn that Benjamin Burkshaw, a criminal of the most desperate character, effected his
escape from Dartmoor prison yesterday. The following is his description: Age, not exactly
known; eyes, nothing peculiar; wears a long black beard—has probably cut it off; walks
slightly lame with one leg, uncertain which; supposed to have directed his steps towards
London, or in some other direction.” Dear me! it is just possible he may be in this very
train! (<i>looking aside at the </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>,<i> then
reading again</i>). “Middle height” (<i>looking again at </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>); “inclined to be stout” (<i>another look at
</i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>); he’s so rolled up in his rug one can’t
judge! (<i>Reads again.</i>) “Slightly bald, with a scar on left<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-113">[Pg 113]</a></span> side of forehead” (<i>here the
</i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> in his sleep hastily pulls his
travelling-cap over his forehead; the </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> gives a
sudden start, and recoils as far as possible from the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>). How very suddenly he pulled his cap over his
forehead—and the left side of it too! Pshaw! how foolish, how absurd of me! (<i>Reads
paper again, and then closes her eyes once more.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>rousing himself</i>). It’s no use! I
can’t get a wink of sleep, except by fits and starts—principally starts! (<i>Looking at
</i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>.) Still asleep! and no book to read except this
“Illustrated Guide through England and Wales.” However, that’s better than “Bradshaw.”
(<i>During above he has taken a book out of his bag, and cuts the leaves with a
paper-knife; turns over leaves.</i>) What’s this? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Maidenhead. It was in
the neighborhood of this picturesque town that the famous Dick Turpin—” (<i>Here the
</i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> and </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> are suddenly thrown forward.</i>)</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). What a shock! Has anything
happened?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>indifferently</i>). Nothing of
consequence! merely the train passing over something—or somebody!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). Rather an unfeeling remark!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Can you tell me where we are, sir? I am quite a stranger to this line.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. We <i>should</i> be near Slough. You may
not be aware, madam, that it was here that—(<i>taking a peep aside at his book</i>)—“that
the famous Dick Turpin”—you’ve heard of Dick Turpin, of course—the celebrated
highwayman? (L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> shakes her head</i>). Well, it was
here that he was in the habit of spending his leisure hours—I mean when he’d nothing
better to do—in—in (<i>taking another peep at book</i>)—“in planting potatoes!”—Poor Dick!
my great-grandfather saw him hanged!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Hanged?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Yes—I forget exactly what for—something
about putting an old lady on the kitchen fire!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Surely, never was a fate
more richly deserved!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. On the contrary, she was quite a
respectable sort of old body!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aloud, and in a satirical tone</i>). Thanks,
sir, for your kind and <i>interesting</i> information!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>modestly</i>). Don’t mention it, I
beg!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). A newspaper correspondent,
perhaps! I prefer that to a farmer!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>). I find the sun
rather too warm on this side of the carriage, madam—will it inconvenience you if I take
this seat? (<i>indicating first chair at <span class="stage">R</span>.</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Not in the least! Indeed, I should have the less
right to object, as I am afraid I have appropriated <i>yours;</i> and by far the more
comfortable one, I suspect!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. You simply foresaw that I should offer it
to you, madam!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Oh, sir! (<i>bowing</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Oh, madam! (<i>bowing; he removes things
from where the </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> had placed them, and seats
himself opposite to her</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). Really a very pleasant, agreeable
fellow!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). Her full face is even better
than her profile! (<i>Aloud, and in a sentimental tone.</i>) Ah, madam! would it were in
my power to prolong this pleasant journey—this delightful <i>tête-à-tête!</i></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). Sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). That’s no go!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I mean, madam, that one seems to travel <i>too</i> fast nowadays! (L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> expresses surprise.</i>) In fact, we’re <i>all</i> too
fast!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>severely</i>). Sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). <i>That’s</i> no go!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) We’ve only to contrast the present with the time when the wife of one of
our ancient kings traversed the whole of England by easy stages of five miles a day!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Of whom do you speak?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Of—of— (<i>Aside.</i>) Hang me if I know!
(<i>Aloud.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Of Tabitha—I mean Elgitha, the wife of—Edmund—Sobersides—I should say Ironsides! But
without going quite so far back, madam, I confess I often regret the days of those heavy
old stage-coaches called “High-flyers,” “Eclipses,” and “Rockets.”</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Because they went so
slowly?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Precisely. Still, it had its advantages—it
gave one an opportunity to make the acquaintance of one’s travelling companions—to
establish a friendly feeling—perhaps one of a more <i>tender</i> nature! (<i>with a tender
look at the </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>with a stare of astonishment</i>). Sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). It’s no use. I won’t try any
more! (<i>Aloud, and in a more colloquial tone.</i>) Besides, in a stage-coach there was
always the chance of one of those little adventures that so often happened on the
road!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. You mean attacks by highwaymen, such as your
<i>friend</i> Mr.—Turpin—who had a weakness for putting respectable old ladies on the
kitchen fire? (<i>smiling satirically—then, changing her tone</i>). I remember myself a
certain event which happened some five or six years ago when we were travelling.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. <i>We?</i> You and your pa and ma,
probably?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. My husband and I!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Husband? you are married, ma’am! actually,
positively married?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Alas, sir! (<i>sighing</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>aside</i>). I see! an unhappy union!—an
ill-assorted match—poor soul! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Ah, madam, you are not the only one of your
too confiding sex who have found marriage a bed of roses—I mean, of nettles, instead of
one of nettles—I mean roses!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. But, sir—you mistake—alas, sir, I am a
widow!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. A widow? I’m delighted to hear it! No, I’m
not! of course not! I deeply sympathize with you—as I always do with widows—I know what it
is myself. But you mustn’t give way—you’ll get used to it in time—like the eels—no,
not<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-116">[Pg 116]</a></span> like the
eels—but you were about to mention some adventure which happened to you while travelling
with—the late lamented. (<i>Noise heard of train gradually stopping—engine, railway-bell,
whistle, etc.</i>)</p>

<p>V<span class="smallerfont">OICE</span> (<i>outside, gradually approaching</i>).
“Slough! Slough! change for Windsor; all tickets ready.”</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>angrily</i>). All tickets ready! these
railway companies are perfectly absurd, with their mania for examining tickets!
(<i>feeling in his pocket</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Another advantage of the good
old coaching days!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Yes, quite so! (<i>feeling again in his
pockets, one after the other</i>). Ah! here it is—no, it isn’t—how very odd; now I’ve got
it—no, I haven’t! (<i>diving in his pockets again</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. I’m afraid you’ve lost your ticket, sir.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Oh no! I haven’t <i>lost</i> it—only I
can’t find it!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. You may have dropped it? (<i>looking about on
floor</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Pray don’t trouble yourself; I shall be
sure to find it—(<i>aside</i>) as soon as I’ve paid for another! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I’ll just
speak to the station-master. Excuse me a moment? (L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i>
bows, </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> exit at <span
class="stage">C</span>., and disappears towards <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>.</i>)</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Poor fellow! no wonder he dislikes railways if
he’s in the habit of losing his ticket every time he travels!</p>

<p class="entrance">G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span><i> appears at door <span
class="stage">C</span>.</i></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>to </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span>). Ticket, please, ma’am? (<i>Takes ticket, and returns it
to </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>.) Thank you, ma’am. (<i>Seeing the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> bag, etc., on
seat.</i>) These things belong to you, ma’am?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Oh no!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span>. Has any one left this carriage?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes! a gentleman—not a minute ago.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). How can I examine people’s
tickets when they get out at every station?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. He fancies he has lost his ticket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>suspiciously</i>). Lost his ticket?—what a
pity! (<i>Aside.</i>) That’s an old dodge! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Is the gentleman one of your
party, ma’am?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Oh dear no! only so far as we are journeying in
the same compartment.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>examining the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> bag</i>). No
name on his travelling-bag—that’s queer! We’re expected to keep both eyes open on this
line, ma’am—only yesterday we nabbed a desperate bank forger at this very station; and
we’re on the lookout for an escaped convict to-day!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). An escaped convict? that dreadful
Mr. Burkshaw, no doubt? Not a very cheerful subject of conversation—I’m really getting
quite nervous! (<i>collecting her packages and rising</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span>. Going to get out, ma’am?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes, I should prefer the ladies’
compartment.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span>. No room there, ma’am; eight of ’em already,
besides babies!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. I may get into another carriage, I presume?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span>. Certainly, ma’am. Good-day, ma’am (<i>goes out
at door</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Stop! stop! Help me out! Guard! guard!
(<i>calling</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>outside</i>). Can’t stop now, ma’am. Train
just going on.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. This is really too bad! Can’t even change
carriages on this line, which seems to be especially patronized by the criminal classes!
But pshaw! I’m alarming myself unnecessarily. Is it likely that this gentleman—and he
<i>is</i> a gentleman—who seems to be on intimate terms with the wife of Edmund
Ironsides—can possibly have any connection with— How absurd of me! I really ought to be
ashamed of myself. (<i>Seeing the paper-knife which the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> has left on seat.</i>) What a strange-looking
paper-knife—quite a formidable weapon! <i>Is</i> it a paper-knife? it looks more like a
stiletto! (<i>Taking up paper-knife very carefully between her finger and thumb, and then
quickly dropping it again</i>). Such an instrument as that was never made to cut
<i>leaves!</i> It looks much adapted to— (<i>Shuddering.</i>) How ridiculous of me!<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-118">[Pg 118]</a></span> My silly fears are
running away with me again. Ha, ha, ha! (<i>forcing a laugh</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">UARD</span> (<i>without</i>). Take your seats!</p>

<p class="entrance">G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> hurries in at <span
class="stage">C</span>. The </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> suddenly stops
laughing, and gets as far as she can into her corner.</i></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. I’ve found my ticket! I knew I should the
moment I bought another. (<i>Takes his seat. To the </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span>). Where do you suppose it was?—you’ll never guess. In my
purse, where I always put my tickets! Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). He <i>had</i> a ticket, then?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. It is very kind of you to interest yourself
in the misfortunes of a stranger (<i>bowing</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Is it not natural?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. It seems to be so to <i>you,</i> madam
(<i>bowing again and moving a little towards </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>,<i>
who retreats</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). If I could only induce him to
remove his travelling-cap—not that I should discover the slightest scar on <i>his</i>
forehead—I should then be completely reassured. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Pardon me—is not that a
friend of yours bowing to you on the other platform? (<i>indicating the audience</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Bowing to me? where? (<i>putting his hand
to his cap</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>pointing</i>). There! (<i>Aside.</i>) Now for
it!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>lowering his hand again without removing
his cap</i>). No, ma’am, I don’t know him; besides, he’s not bowing to me.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). That’s a failure!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Holloa! Somebody’s been moving my
things!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes, the guard!—he seemed curious—I might say
<i>anxious</i>—to ascertain if your name was on your travelling-bag!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Very inquisitive of him! Why should I make
my name public property?—there may be reasons why I should <i>not!</i>—pressing reasons!
You can understand that, madam?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Y—es! I’m afraid I can—I mean, of course I
can!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. But, as I was saying, the interest you have
so kindly taken in me—a perfect stranger—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). Not at all, sir; on the
contrary! No—that is—</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Permit me to continue. That interest, I
repeat, comes naturally to <i>you,</i> blessed, as I’m sure you are, with so sweet, so
gentle, so affectionate a disposition.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>very quickly</i>). Quite the reverse, I
assure you, sir—I’ve a dreadful temper!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Again: that charming hand is not less
characteristic; it requires but one glance at those delicately tapered fingers— (<i>About
to take her hand; </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> hastily withdraws
it.</i>)</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). I do believe the man’s going to
make love to me!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. But stay: I see one line here that is
singularly prominent; permit me (<i>taking </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). I’m quite at his mercy! Not the
slightest use my screaming!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>looking at her hand</i>). Yes, a very
sudden intersection, threatening, I fear, some personal danger.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). Yes, very likely!
(<i>Aside.</i>) How intently he fixes his eyes on my diamond ring!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. But were you not saying that you had once
been exposed to some peril in travelling?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes; but I was not <i>alone</i> then.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. The “late lamented,” I presume?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes; we were attacked by robbers in crossing the
Pyrenees! (<i>Very quickly.</i>) Not that I particularly object to robbers! In fact, I
rather like them! (<i>Aside.</i>) I may as well try what a little flattery will do.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>still holding her hand</i>). You have a
remarkably fine diamond here, madam!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes, a very good <i>imitation,</i> isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Excuse me. I cannot mistake a diamond—no,
no; I’ve had too many pass through my hands to do that!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). I’m afraid he has!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. And yet there’s a flaw in it—if you’ll
allow me, I’ll point it out to you. (<i>Looking about, then suddenly taking up the
paper-knife; the </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> screams.</i>) I’m afraid I
alarmed you!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>trying to be calm</i>). Oh dear no! and if
you’ve quite done examining my hand—</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Quite, madam! (<i>releasing her
hand</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. And you detect no further threatening
of—personal danger?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. None whatever!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Then you are a believer in spiritualism and
phrenology, and all that sort of thing?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Certainly I am! May I ask, madam, if you
have ever examined the head of a criminal?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Never, sir!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Perhaps you have never even been brought
into personal contact with one?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Certainly not, sir; though I’m sure I should
feel the greatest pity for him—I should, indeed! (<i>in a commiserating tone</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Understand me; I don’t allude to the
<i>milder</i> class of criminals, such as thieves, robbers, forgers, burglars, and such
like; but one of those desperate fellows who—who—in fact, who <i>stick at nothing!</i>
By-the-bye, I have a collection here of photographs of some of our most notorious
criminals, which I think would interest you.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>shuddering</i>). Yes—intensely!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>opening his travelling-bag</i>). Ah!
(<i>producing a revolver</i>) there’s rather a curious story connected with this
revolver!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>alarmed, and trying to look unconcerned</i>).
Indeed?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. I never travel without one—every
chamber<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-121">[Pg 121]</a></span> loaded
and ready for use, so that I have six lives at my disposal—a very comfortable feeling to
have! Don’t you think so?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes, very much so, indeed!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Here are the photographs (<i>producing
packet</i>); here is one of them (<i>about to show a portrait</i>). No, I make a mistake;
this is one of myself.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aghast</i>). Yours?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes! this is the one!
(<i>presenting a second portrait</i>). You’ll observe a remarkable protuberance of this
part of the skull (<i>pointing to it</i>); that’s the organ of destructiveness. I have it
myself, only not <i>quite</i> so strongly developed! (<i>touching his head</i>); don’t you
perceive it?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes—I—see! But I confess I cannot understand how
<i>you</i> happen to be in possession of these <i>remarkably interesting</i>—works of
art?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>smiling</i>). A very simple matter—my
occupation necessitates my associating with this particular class of “her Majesty’s
subjects”—as I happen to be—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Hush! I know! You need not tell
me!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). What is the matter? You
are positively trembling—with cold, no doubt! Allow me to wrap this rug round you.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. No, no!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Nay, I insist! (<i>placing his rug round
</i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i>
feet</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. But you will feel the want of it yourself,
especially as it seems you have passed the night in the train!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Exactly! Six hours ago I was in Dartmoor
Prison!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Dartmoor! (<i>Aside.</i>) He confesses it!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Not a very attractive
residence. I would gladly have left it before, but, unfortunately, I was detained!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Detained!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I may say <i>chained</i>
to it—by my confounded profession!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>aside</i>). He calls it a
<i>profession!</i></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. There’s no saying how long the Home
Secretary might have kept me there; but I couldn’t stand it any longer, so I managed to
make my escape, and now I’m free once more!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>suddenly starting up with a scream</i>).
Stop, sir! Don’t say any more! Have pity on me, for mercy’s sake! (<i>falling on her knees
and clasping her hands</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>astounded</i>). My dear madam—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>hysterically</i>). I know who you are; I know
all about the scar on your forehead! But I won’t betray you—I won’t, indeed! Here, take my
purse!—take my watch! (<i>thrusting the articles into the </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i>
hands</i>)—<i>all</i> I have, good Mr. Burkshaw!—but spare my life!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Your life? Mr. Burkshaw? What—what do you
mean?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Mercy! mercy!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>seriously</i>). My dear madam! Pray
compose yourself! You have evidently fallen into some strange error; in a word, I happen
to be—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Yes, yes! I know who you happen to be! Take my
advice and jump out of the train!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Jump out of the train?
Madam, your strange conduct compels me to be serious! In a word, I have the honor to be a
Government inspector of prisons!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Eh? What? You—an inspector of prisons?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Yes, madam (<i>taking off his cap and
bowing to </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>eagerly looking at </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> forehead</i>).
And—you <i>haven’t</i> got a scar on your forehead? Oh, sir! if you only knew how
delighted I am that you haven’t got a scar on your forehead!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>bewildered</i>). A scar on my forehead?
(<i>feeling his forehead</i>). But may I ask what has suggested to you all these notions
about thieves and robbers?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Why, you’ve been talking about nothing else for
the last quarter of an hour!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I beg your pardon. You
certainly first began the conversation about these—<i>gentlemen.</i></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Because you said that you associated with
them.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Naturally, as an inspector of prisons.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Then those portraits—in your possession?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. Were taken merely to forward the ends of
justice!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> (<i>with a sigh of relief</i>). I understand it
all! I can laugh at my folly now, which entirely arose from this silly newspaper
paragraph—the sole cause of all my absurd terror.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>. What newspaper paragraph?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. Read this, sir (<i>giving him
newspaper</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>looking at paper, and then giving way to
a loud laugh</i>). Ha, ha, ha! Why, my dear madam, this is quite an old story! Our
interesting friend, Mr. Burkshaw, happened to be shot in attempting his escape from
Dartmoor more than twelve months ago! (<i>Looking at date of newspaper.</i>) Of course,
this paper is a year old—December, 1884!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. So it is! Oh, sir! what must you think of
me?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>in a tender tone</i>). May I tell you?
That you are the most charming travelling companion— (<i>Here noise of train stopping,
engine, railway-whistle, etc., heard.</i>)</p>

<p>V<span class="smallerfont">OICE</span> (<i>outside</i>). Paddington! Paddington!
(L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span><i> and </i>G<span
class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span><i> both rise.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span> (<i>gallantly</i>). I am staying some time
in London, madam. Will you permit me to call upon you, if only to remove from your mind
any lingering doubt as to my perfect identity?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span>. With pleasure, sir! (<i>Suddenly, and in a very
gracious</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<i>tone.</i>) Oh, sir! how <i>very</i> good of you to be a Government inspector of
prisons! (<i>holding out her hand to </i>G<span class="smallerfont">ENTLEMAN</span>,<i>
who takes it and raises it to his lips</i>).</p>

<p>V<span class="smallerfont">OICE</span> (<i>again heard</i>). Paddington! (<i>The

curtains at <span class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">U</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">E</span>., conservatory <span class="stage">C</span>., doors <span

class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span><i> discovered lying on couch, his handkerchief over his
head—</i>A<span class="smallerfont">RTHUR</span> V<span class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span>
<i>in morning costume.</i></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>looking at </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span>). Still asleep! And yet I must awake him (<i>striking a
very loud chord on the piano</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>pulling handkerchief off his head and sitting
bolt upright on couch</i>). Come in! (<i>Seeing </i>A<span
class="smallerfont">RTHUR</span>.) Oh, it’s you? For goodness’ sake, Arthur, don’t make
such an infernal noise! Do you want to dislocate that implement of torture?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Don’t you like it, uncle? I thought you were
fond of music!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. You don’t call that music, do you? (<i>getting up
from couch</i>). I accept your friend Fritterly’s invitation to his country-house for a
few weeks’ quiet—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, you’ve got it, haven’t you?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Don’t interrupt me (<i>snappishly</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I was merely anticipating—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Who the deuce wants you to anticipate! Take
things as I do, and wait till they come round! My idea of a quiet life is to get up at
eleven, when the world has been thoroughly aired by that beneficent warming-pan, the sun;
next, breakfast at twelve—twelve’s a lovely hour for breakfast—have the morning papers all
to yourself, and escape being dragged round the grounds like the rest of the visitors—to
see the early peas, and the asparagus beds, and spring onions!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Ha! ha! Well, what next?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Breakfast over, a quiet nap; a bit of lunch at
three; a heavenly slumber till dinner-time at seven; a cup of coffee, a cigar, and to bed
at ten! That’s my idea of a rational, peaceful existence!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. You’d better by half shoulder your gun and have
a pop at the partridges!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Thankee—I never went out with a gun but once in
my life, and then I shot a couple of dogs and a game-keeper; so I gave it up; for if I’d
gone on as I began, dogs and game-keepers would have been at a premium long before
this!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Ah! it was a bad business for you, uncle, that
you didn’t take a wife.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. It would have been a precious deal worse for my
wife if I had!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, every one to his taste. What you call
existence <i>I</i> call a state of positive torpidity. It may suit <i>you;</i> but at my
age a man hungers and thirsts after a little more excitement.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Then why the deuce don’t you take it? Go out
fishing—in the duck-pond—or go and see the cows milked, or the pigs fed; or, better still,
here’s no end of excitement for you under your very nose.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Where?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. At that window (<i>pointing to window</i>);
gardener always at work rolling the lawn, or watering the flowers, or picking up worms, or
killing slugs, and without the slightest fatigue for<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-127">[Pg 127]</a></span> you; all you have to do is to settle
yourself down at the window—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Settle down, eh? My dear uncle, that’s the very
thing I want to do! In a word, Myrtle Vane—Lady Fritterly’s sister—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Ugh! The old story over again, eh? Lady
Fritterly’s sister is a niceish sort of girl—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>indignantly</i>). Niceish sort of girl!
She’s an angel!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Rubbish! Besides, as I said before, you’re too
young to marry yet; wait another ten or fifteen years, and then begin to look about you.
You haven’t popped to her, have you?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Popped?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Proposed!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. No!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Then how do you know she’d have you?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Of course I don’t <i>know;</i> but I think she
<i>might.</i></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. There’s a conceited young puppy for you!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>coaxingly</i>). Especially if you’ll
encourage my attentions—like my dear, kind old uncle!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Which your “dear, kind old uncle” doesn’t intend
to do.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. You don’t, eh? Very well, then listen to me! I
shall do something desperate!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Wait till I get out of the room! (<i>Feeling his
pulse.</i>) I thought as much! Going like a windmill in a gale of wind! This excitement’s
too much for me, I must take a sedative! (<i>takes pillbox out of his pocket; opens it,
and tosses two pills into his mouth one after the other</i>). And now, young fellow,
listen to me. If you are so anxious to <i>settle,</i> as you call it, better begin with
your bootmaker! In a word, you don’t marry yet with my consent. Marry <i>without</i> it,
and I leave every shilling I’ve got to—to the Society for the Suppression of Virtue—I mean
the Propagation of Vice—I don’t know what I’m talking about! (<i>swallows two more pills,
and hurries out at <span class="stage">R</span>., slamming door violently after
him</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Just as easy to argue him out of his prejudices
as it would be to make a Quaker kick his mother’s— Oh! here comes Myrtle! What a
contrast!—he all apathy—she all impetuosity! Of course I shall have to give her an account
of my morning’s employment, as usual, which consists of breakfast—three slices of toast, a
rasher of bacon, a couple of eggs, and a cup of coffee! and not a bad morning’s work,
either!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>M<span class="smallerfont">YRTLE</span><i> at <span
class="stage">C</span>. in morning dress—a large garden hat and gloves.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Good-morning, Mr. Vallance! has nature no
attractions for you, that you remain in-doors such a lovely day as this? Following your
uncle’s example, as usual, I presume?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. On the contrary, I’ve been very hard at work, I
assure you, trying to reduce my uncle’s bump of obstinacy.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. But in vain?—the <i>protuberance</i> defied your
efforts. And has that been your entire morning’s work?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Physically, yes! Mentally, no!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. The <i>physical</i> we’ll dismiss; the
<i>mental</i> consisting of—reading the newspaper, eh? (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. What can a man do such weather as this? It’s too
hot to walk, too early for billiards—only fit for smoking. By-the-bye, I <i>did</i> manage
to get as far as the stables, where I had a cigar.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. And this is the new leaf you promised me you
would turn over—a tobacco-leaf! You are sadly deficient in energy, Mr. Vallance.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I confess it. But brought up as I was from my
earliest infancy under my uncle—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. (<i>smiling</i>). Under your uncle?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Yes—(<i>suddenly</i>)—no, of course not. I mean
under his <i>supervision</i>—how can I be otherwise than I am? He resents the slightest
approach to activity as a slur on himself; and the highest compliment you can pay him is
to yawn in his face (<i>checking a yawn with difficulty</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. I beg pardon—I’m afraid I’m in the way.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Not at all! But why are you in such a hurry to
go?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. To allow you more leisure for (<i>imitating
</i>A<span class="smallerfont">RTHUR</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i>
yawn</i>)—you know!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Oh, Myrtle—do you object to my calling you
Myrtle?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. You should have asked that question before you
<i>did.</i></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. If my tongue has been silent, surely my eyes
must have spoken for me?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. (<i>stiffly</i>). Mr. Vallance, you forget
yourself!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Because I was thinking of you
(<i>tenderly</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. (<i>aside</i>). This is getting too serious.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) But you really must excuse me. I have my plants to attend to—a favorite
creeper especially that requires nailing up.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Let me go with you. I’ll make myself so
useful—you’ll see how hard I’ll work. I’ll hold the ladder for you, and hand you up the
hammer and tin-tacks!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. What an exertion! And all for me! Ha! ha!
ha!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>annoyed</i>). I see how it is, madam; you’ve
no feeling, or you wouldn’t treat me so cruelly, so capriciously! If you had the slightest
particle of regard for me, you’d let me hand you up the hammer and tin-tacks!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. You accuse <i>me</i> of caprice! <i>you,</i> who
never knew what it is to be in earnest!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I am so <i>now,</i> I assure you.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Then listen to me, Arthur Vallance. Let me see
that you possess some energy, some enthusiasm, some strength of will, then I may, perhaps,
give you a better answer. Good-morning.</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Goes out at <span class="stage">C</span>. towards <span
class="stage">R</span>.</i></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>calling after</i>). Stop, Myrtle! <i>Do</i>
let me come and hand you up the hammer and tin-tacks! So! I’m to do something energetic,
am I? Drown myself in the duck-pond? Yes!—no. I have it! I’ll say good-by to Fritterly,
and cut this place at once! And then, Miss Vane, perhaps you’ll be sorry—perhaps you’ll
regret that you didn’t let me hand you up the<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-130">[Pg 130]</a></span> hammer and tin-tacks! Let me see, there’s an express to
town at three. (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) I can catch that. My traps can follow
(<i>hurrying up towards door <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>., and coming into collision with </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">IR</span> F<span class="smallerfont">ELIX</span>,<i> who enters at the
same time</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Holloa, old fellow, where the deuce are you off
to in such a hurry?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Don’t ask me—I’m going out of my mind!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. The deuce you are! Well, if I may judge by
appearances, it won’t take you very long to get to the end of <i>that</i> journey!
Confound it, man, will you explain?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, you know the feelings I entertain towards
Miss Vane?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Myrtle? Yes.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, you’ll hardly believe it; but when I
proposed to her just now—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. You proposed to her? (<i>astonished</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Yes—to hand her up the hammer and tin-tacks—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>astonished</i>). Hammer and tin-tacks? What
the deuce are you talking about?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>helplessly</i>). I’m sure I don’t know—yes,
I do. She said that when I showed a little energy—a little enthusiasm—a little something
else, she’d perhaps give me a better answer.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. A better answer! What on earth can that
mean?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I can’t tell! (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Yes, I can, of
course! It can only mean one thing (<i>enthusiastically</i>)—that she <i>will</i> let me
hand her up the hammer—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>shouting</i>). Confound it, drop that
hammer! You’ve been hammering that hammer into my ears for the last ten minutes! Now!
(<i>turning </i>V<span class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span><i> round to him face to
face</i>) speak like a man of sense—if you’ve got any left in you!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, then, I ventured to speak to my uncle—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Old Cosey?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Yes, old Cosey—about Myrtle, and he coolly told
me I mustn’t think of getting married for the next ten or fifteen years!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Come, I like that!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Do you? It’s more than I do—unless, he said, he
saw some urgent necessity for it; but that if I married without his consent he’d
disinherit me.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Is that all?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. All! It strikes me as being quite enough. No, it
isn’t all—it’s only half, for Myrtle—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>cutting him short</i>). Never mind Myrtle;
I know all about her. She thinks you a bit of a milksop—s—so do I; that you’ve no
energy—not an atom! no will of your own—never had! and that in order to reinstate yourself
in her good opinion you must do something <i>desperate!</i> So you shall! Now what do you
mean to do?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Show a proper spirit, and—run away!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Run away! Certainly not—fling yourself into my
arms and I’ll pull you through! So cheer up!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. It’s very easy to say “cheer up” to a fellow who
feels himself between two stools, with the certainty of coming down a cropper!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. But what’s the use of giving you advice? You’d
never follow it! You haven’t the pluck to do anything desperate!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I told uncle I would! But I’m not going to make
away with myself merely to prove that I’m a man of my word!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Pshaw! Now let’s understand each other. Myrtle
insists on your giving her a convincing proof of energy—pluck—determination—and all that
sort of thing! You’re not limited as to the direction they may take?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Not at all!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Good—and your uncle refuses his consent to your
marriage unless he sees some urgent necessity for it?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Exactly!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Then the same medicine will do for both! Old
Cosey has a great regard for propriety and morality, and all that sort of thing—hasn’t
he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Intense!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Then we’ll give him such a shock on that score,
he’ll think that his opposition to your wishes has driven you frantic with despair!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. But Myrtle?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Has only to imagine there’s a chance of your
turning out a “naughty, good-for-nothing reprobate,” and she’ll be only too glad to
reclaim her lost sheep at once!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. What then?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Oh, then we must borrow a wrinkle from the
French! As your uncle won’t hear of your taking a wife of your own, take somebody
else’s!—no matter whose. Take <i>mine;</i> she’s the handiest!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Don’t be absurd!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. I’m perfectly serious! All your uncle wants is
to snooze away his existence. We must wake the old boy up!!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. How?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. By an elopement!! A <i>pretended</i> one, of
course, which you shall propose to my wife, and <i>he</i> shall overhear!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. <i>I</i> propose an elopement to Lady Fritterly?
She’ll be indignant!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. How do you know that? She may feel flattered!
At any rate I’ll take all the responsibility!—you may be as fascinating as you choose! Ha!
ha!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. But, man alive, I’m not in the habit of running
away with other people’s wives! I shouldn’t know how to begin. Something in this
style?—“Please, ma’am, will you run away with me?”</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Not half tender enough! (<i>Clasping his hands
and with exaggerated passion.</i>) “Loveliest of women”—then down on your knee—it don’t
matter which—both if you like. Then exclaim, “My bosom’s torn with conflicting
emotions”—“my brain is in a whirlwind of agony and despair”—tearing your hair out by
handfuls all the time. Don’t forget <i>that!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Stop! Don’t be in such a confounded hurry! Let
me see! “Loveliest of women,” one! (<i>counting on his fingers</i>)—“conflicting
emotions,” two!—“agony,” three!—“despair,” four! Can’t you make it five—one for each
finger?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Five—the elopement!—<i>there</i> you must come
out a little stronger—(<i>declaiming in exaggerated tone</i>)—“Let us fly, loved
one!—horses are in readiness to bear us to the nearest station, where the flashing express
shall whirl us to—to—” anywhere you like—Madagascar—Seringapatam—Pegwell Bay—no
matter!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Oh! that’s the style, is it? By Jove, I’ve half
a mind to chance it! But when is this precious scheme of yours to come off?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. At once! As soon as I can secure the presence
of my wife, and old Cosey as a listener!—he always takes a nap on this couch when the
coast is clear—(<i>turns the couch round with back to the audience</i>). There!—now, you
take a stroll in the grounds—I’ll hide behind the window-curtains and give you the signal
to come in. Be off! (<i>pushing him up stage</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Wait a minute—(<i>counting on his
fingers</i>)—“Loveliest of women,” “conflicting emotions,” “agony,” “paggony”—no, not
“paggony,” “despair.” Let me see, what’s the little finger?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. The elopement!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. All right!</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Exit at <span class="stage">C</span>. towards <span
class="stage">R</span>., counting his fingers.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. He’s gone at last! I ought to have been born in
an atmosphere of diplomacy to develop my talent for intrigue! Ha, ha, ha! how this “little
game” of mine will astonish them! But they all want waking up in this house! Cosey’s an
old hedgehog, all prickles and prejudices! Arthur’s—never mind what! Myrtle’s a

dreadfully proper! Shall I take her into my confidence? No! she hates jokes—especially

wonder if she overheard!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. You seem merry!—laughing at your own jokes?
Quite right you should, for nobody else does!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Thank you! (<i>Aside.</i>) All right! she
didn’t hear anything. Perhaps I’d better prepare her, just a little bit, or she might
petrify poor Arthur with one of her tragedy looks before he opens his mouth, and then he’d
take to his heels to a certainty! (<i>Aloud.</i>) By-the-bye, my dear Grace, have you
noticed anything peculiar in young Vallance’s behavior lately?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. No; he seems as apathetic as ever; he may,
perhaps, have shown a little more attention to me than usual (<i>with intention</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>aside</i>). The deuce he has! I wonder what
she’ll say presently when he comes out with his “agony” and “despair?” (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
don’t mean his behavior to <i>you</i>—but to Myrtle! He’s not half so spooney—I mean
attentive—as he used to be, and I fear there’s a reason for it! (<i>with
significance</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Indeed!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Yes! he <i>may</i> be smitten with
<i>somebody</i> else! At <i>his</i> age the affections are fickle, volatile—skipping like
a flea—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Felix!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. I mean <i>sipping like a bee</i> from flower to
flower! Myrtle is young—very young; but even youth like hers <i>may</i> become insipid!
The love of every precocious boy of fifteen is a woman of <i>thirty!</i> I began at
twelve!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. A woman of thirty—<i>my</i> age! Understand,
sir, that no woman cares to be reminded of her age when she is turned<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-135">[Pg 135]</a></span> thirty, any more than
that she wears false hair! Your remark, therefore, is scarcely polite; but with your wife
it appears you consider no such politeness necessary!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Politeness! My dear Grace, what is politeness,
after all?—merely the gloss of society! I suppose you’ll admit that the shiny stuff they
put on the top of the buns doesn’t make them taste any the sweeter?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Spare me your absurd similes, and don’t
mistake flippancy for wit!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>aside</i>). That’s a dig in the ribs for
me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) But we are wandering from our subject! Do you think Myrtle loves
Vallance at all?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. I fancy she likes him well enough!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. “Well enough” won’t do! She must like him a
<i>great deal</i> better—as I believe she would if we could only make her just a little
bit jealous!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Perhaps so—but how? My lady’s-maid is no
beauty! The house-maid’s no chicken! The cook’s too fat! And there’s no one else!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. No, exactly! (<i>Here </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F<span class="smallerfont">RITTERLY</span><i> turns and
goes up stage.</i>) Are you going out this morning?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Yes, unless you wish for the pleasure of my
society here!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Well, it would be a novelty!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. And you promise to spare me the infliction of
those melancholy exhibitions which you call jokes?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. I’ll be as dull as an undertaker! Suppose you
put a few stitches into that smoking-cap of mine, which has been your sole occupation in
needle-work for the last two years and a half!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Be it so! It’s in my room—I’ll fetch it!
(<i>Aside as she goes up stage.</i>) So—so—he’s evidently got some “little game” on
hand—which it will be my business to find out! (<i>Turning to </i>S<span

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Goes out at door <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Poor, unsuspecting innocent, it’s too bad to
take<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-136">[Pg 136]</a></span> advantage
of her simplicity! Ah! here comes old Cosey for his forty winks—better and better—but he

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Nobody here! got it all to myself! That’s just
what I like! I was afraid of meeting Fritterly! He’s a pleasant fellow enough in his way,
but I prefer being <i>out</i> of his way! To be within the sound of his voice is like
living over a printing-office—one continual clatter! Now, then, for a little solitary
rumination!—there’s nothing equals it. Look at a cow—how she enjoys it! and isn’t she the
most peaceful of all animals? Who ever heard of a cow in a passion? See the touching
resignation with which she allows herself to be milked! I wish Arthur had more of that
docile animal in his composition! he wouldn’t talk of doing something desperate! Now,
then, for a delicious nap! (<i>Ties his handkerchief over his head and lies down on couch,
and no longer in sight of audience.</i>)</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>peeping from behind curtain</i>). Thank
you, colonel, for your flattering opinion of me; but I’ll be even with you! I wonder if
he’s asleep? (<i>advancing on tiptoe to couch</i>). Yes, sound as a top! Now, then, to
call in Arthur! Stop a bit! let me first perform the part of the benevolent robin in the
“Babes in the Wood,” and cover this “Sleeping Beauty” up! (<i>Carefully spreading several
antimacassars over </i>C<span class="smallerfont">OSEY</span>.) There! now for Arthur!
(<i>Runs to window and waves his hand.</i>) All right; he sees me!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Well, you still stick to your plan?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Like a horse-leech. My wife will be here
directly!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. But Uncle Cosey?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Comfortably tucked in there (<i>pointing to

implement (<i>taking a long feather brush</i>). Sure you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a

drama by heart? Rehearse!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. “Loveliest of women,” “emotions,” “agony,”
“Seringapatam,” “despair,” “Pegwell Bay”—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Keep on going over it, like the
multiplication-table; but hang it, man, don’t look as lively as if you were waiting in a
dentist’s back parlor! (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Here comes my wife! (<i>hurriedly hiding behind

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Lady Fritterly! (<i>bowing</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>aside</i>). The ball is about to open!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Won’t you be seated? (<i>seating herself at <span class="stage">L</span>.,
</i>A<span class="smallerfont">RTHUR</span><i> moving a chair to some distance from
</i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F.,<i> and seating himself</i>). A lovely
morning, is it not? (<i>beginning to work at the smoking-cap</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Delicious!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Quite cool and pleasant!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aside</i>). I feel quite hot and

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. By-the-bye, do you know where my husband
is?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>fidgeting on his chair</i>). Not exactly;
but I believe he’s somewhere or other, or if not there, somewhere else.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>who has peeped out, listening</i>). Idiot!
(<i>hiding again</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>observing the movement of the curtain.

to him for leaving so agreeable a substitute.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>listening</i>). That ought to encourage
him!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aside</i>). It’s time I began, if I’m going
to begin at all! (<i>Suddenly, and clasping his hands.</i>) Oh, Lady Fritterly, pardon my
agitation; but agitated as I am with the agitations that agitate me—the agony, the
despair— (<i>Aside.</i>) I shall stick fast presently; I know I shall!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>listening</i>). That’s better.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. But say—say you forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Forgive you! for what? (<i>insinuatingly, and
moving her chair nearer to </i>A<span class="smallerfont">RTHUR</span>,<i> who draws his
back</i>).</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. For the confession which, alas! (<i>here a very
deep sigh</i>) I am about to make.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Continue, I beg!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Oh, madam, dear madam, dearest madam, if you
only knew <i>all!</i></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Hall? A gentleman of your acquaintance?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. I didn’t say <i>Hall,</i> madam! Let me observe,
Lady Fritterly, that this is no subject for levity.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. No one would imagine it was, from your
countenance, Mr. Vallance. Its solemnity is positively, painfully ludicrous!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>listening</i>). Why the deuce don’t he open
his batteries?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>seeing </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">IR</span> F<span class="smallerfont">ELIX</span>,<i> who is making
energetic signs to him to proceed with his love-making. Aside</i>). Well, since he will
insist upon it, here goes! (<i>Aloud, and in an ultra impassioned tone.</i>) Loveliest of
women!—pardon the apparent insanity of the remark—I love you! adore you! in fact, I rather
like you! Behold me at your feet! (<i>flopping down on one knee. Here </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">IR</span> F.<i> reaches over and tickles </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OSEY</span><i> with the feather brush, who starts up and shows his
head above the back of couch; then, seeing he is not alone, withdraws his head again out

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>with pretended emotion</i>). Love me, Mr.
Vallance? (<i>Aside.</i>) So this is the “little game,” is it? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, is
that all?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. All? (<i>Aside</i>). And pretty well too, I
think; what the deuce <i>would</i> she have? (<i>Aloud, and very enthusiastically.</i>)
No, madam, it is <i>not</i> all! I’ve only just begun! Oh, could you but know the
conflicting emotions, the agony, the despair— (<i>counting on his fingers. Aside.</i>) I
forgot the rest! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Say, say that you love me in return! (<i>seizing her
hand</i>).</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>with pretended emotion</i>). Oh, Mr.
Vallance, you’re too vehement; release my hand!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aside</i>). Release her hand! Come, I like
that! I wish she’d let go of <i>mine</i> (<i>trying to disengage his hand, then catching
another glimpse of </i>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F.,<i> who by signs encourages
him to proceed. Aloud</i>). Release this hand? Not till I’ve finished! Loved one! let us
fly; horses are waiting—flashing express—distant clime—Seringapatam—Madagascar—the
Sandwich Islands—anywhere.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>with pretended emotion and an affecting
faintness</i>). A sudden faintness (<i>leaning against </i>V<span

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>looking out</i>). Holloa! holloa!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>looking up in </i>A<span

sentimentality</i>). Oh! Arthur, Arthur!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>behind</i>). Damn it, she calls him
Arthur!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aside</i>). I’ve been getting on <i>too</i>
fast!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>pathetically to </i>V<span
class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span>). Spare my blushes; I guess all you would say.</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aside</i>). Do you? That’s lucky, for
<i>I’m</i> regularly stumped.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>suddenly grasping </i>V<span
class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span><i> by the wrist and dragging him forward, almost
upsetting him</i>). Listen! my husband is not unkind, though he might be kinder; he is not
ill-looking, indeed, he <i>might</i> be uglier; <i>but</i> he has one terrible defect.
(S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F.<i> here leans forward and listens.</i>) He really
flatters himself that he possesses a fund of wit; that he is literally running over with
fun; whereas the poor man really doesn’t possess a single particle of either. It’s very
sad, isn’t it?</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Melancholy in the extreme.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. And I’m sure, as for humor—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. He’s just about as much in him as an old cab
horse! (F<span class="smallerfont">ELIX</span><i> shakes his fist at </i>V<span
class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span>.)</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. But alas! for every one of his dismal jokes
that <i>you</i> hear <i>I</i> am doomed to listen to a hundred! Is it to be wondered at,
then, that I should pant, <i>crave</i> for a change?—(<i>gradually getting more
excited</i>)—that I should find the temptation you offer me too great to resist?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>aghast</i>). Eh! what? You don’t mean to say
you consent?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Of course I do! (<i>with enthusiasm</i>). What
woman <i>could</i> resist the Sandwich Islands, and <i>you</i> for a companion! In five
minutes expect me here on this spot. Give me but time to pack up my jewels, a dozen or two
dresses, and a sprinkling of hats, and I’ll be with you, my Arthur! (<i>Going—stops.</i>)
You won’t mind my bringing my favorite little pug-dog, of course you won’t—(<i>going—stops
again</i>)—and a couple of kittens—a thousand thanks—and you won’t object to putting the
parrot cage under your arm? I thought not.</p>

me!—except that I didn’t tear my hair out by handfuls!</p>

at the very least! (<i>tossing a couple of pills into his mouth—then to </i>V<span

Fritterly, and proposing an elopement to her? It’s scandalous, sir!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Not the slightest doubt about it, uncle! but I
only did it to oblige Sir Felix!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. <i>Oblige</i> Sir Felix by running off with his

handkerchief, and seeing her. Aside</i>). She’s there! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes, Myrtle, I’m a
wretched, abandoned man!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. You can’t be serious?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. It’s too true!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. What—what do you intend doing?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. I did think of shooting the young man!—but
it’ll be a far greater punishment to let him live! Think what the poor, unhappy youth will
have to suffer from Grace’s “little bits of temper!” poor devil! I know what <i>I</i> had
to go through. (L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F.<i> shakes her hand at </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">IR</span> F.)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. But surely you will try and prevent Grace’s
departure?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>indifferently</i>). I think not!—better as
it is. I’m getting<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-144">[Pg
144]</a></span> used to the idea! I confess it was I who advised Vallance to make just a
certain little amount of love to my wife in order to excite your jealousy and show you
what energy the young man was capable of; but I must confess I was not at all prepared for
the perfect torrent of impassioned eloquence with which he poured forth his
<i>unhallowed</i> flame! (<i>Here </i>V<span class="smallerfont">ALLANCE</span><i> shakes
both his fists at </i>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F.)</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Besides, Myrtle, <i>dear</i> Myrtle, as you
very sensibly observed just now, shall I not have <i>you</i> to console me? (<i>with an
exaggerated tender look</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. (<i>alarmed</i>). Me?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Why not? Your lover doesn’t care a pin’s point
about you, or he wouldn’t have agreed to my plan. My wife has about the same amount of
affection for <i>me,</i> or she’d have withered him up with her scorn at the first go-off.
This sort of thing! (<i>putting on a haughty and scornful look</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Well, what then?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Can you ask? Oh, my Myrtle! my beloved
Myrtle—behold me at your feet! (<i>falling on both his knees and seizing her hand.
Aside.</i>) If Grace stands this, I’m a New Zealander!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Monster! (<i>flinging </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">IR</span> F<span class="smallerfont">ELIX</span><i> from her, who
falls on his face. </i>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F<span

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. So, Sir Felix Fritterly!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. So, Sir Felix Fritterly!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>getting up quietly and dusting his knees
with his pocket-handkerchief. Then suddenly bursting out into a loud laugh</i>). Ha, ha,
ha! Surely, my dear Grace, you didn’t really think I was in earnest?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>smiling</i>). As much in earnest,
probably, as you thought me. (S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F<span
class="smallerfont">ELIX</span><i> takes her hand and kisses it.</i>)</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. (<i>joyously to </i>L<span
class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F.). Then you don’t love me after all? You won’t insist on
my accompanying you to the Sandwich Islands?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>drawing herself up</i>). Mr. Vallance!
(<i>To </i>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F<span class="smallerfont">ELIX</span>.)
Well, I confess you have the best of the game.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. <i>And</i> the last laugh!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Myrtle, have I fulfilled your conditions? have I
shown some little amount of energy?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Yes, with a vengeance!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. And may I hope—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Have him now, Myrtle, while you can get
him!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Keep her to her promise, Mr. Vallance!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Gladly! But it all depends on my uncle how
soon!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. Then he shall decide at once! Turn out, old
tortoise! (<i>Wheels couch round to face the audience, and pulling off the antimacassars,
etc.</i>) Hang me if he isn’t fast asleep! Wake up! (<i>tickling </i>C<span
class="smallerfont">OLONEL</span><i> with the feather brush</i>).</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. All right! Bring me my shaving-water! (<i>Sitting
up, and looking about him.</i>) Holloa!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Have you forgotten all about the elopement,
uncle?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Elopement! Why, you ought to have been half way
to the Sandwich Islands by this time!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Ha! ha! We’ve arranged that little matter
differently.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>crustily</i>). Then what the deuce did you
wake me up for?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. To let you go off to sleep again in a more
comfortable frame of mind.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. Come, colonel! Arthur’s desperately in love
with Myrtle.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. And Myrtle’s over head and ears in love
with—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. (<i>interrupting him</i>). Felix!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. With herself! They only wait your
benediction.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Bother the benediction! I’ll settle a thousand a
year on them!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. (<i>shaking his hand</i>). The most sensible
thing you’ve said for a long time; and now you may go to sleep again as soon as you
like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. Thank you! (<i>Feeling his pulse.</i>) Ninety!
That’s better!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> F. But a word at parting here! (<i>To
audience.</i>) How account for our eccentric behavior? Shall we boldly forestall the
critics and say at once—</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">YRT</span>. Quite foreign in sentiment—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">RTH</span>. Obviously borrowed from our lively
neighbors—</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">OL</span>. (<i>sententiously</i>). Possessing all their
levity with regard to those domestic ties—</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> F. (<i>putting her hand over his mouth</i>). In
short—Taken from the French!</p>

ring—noise of voices in dispute heard outside.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>without</i>). Don’t tell me! I saw you do
it! You needn’t apologize! What do you say—“You ain’t a-going to?” Very well! (<i>another
violent ring at bell</i>).</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span><i> from house and
crossing to <span class="stage">R</span>.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Who can it be ringing in that style, I wonder?
(<i>opens door in <span class="stage">C</span>. of wall</i>).</p>

<p class="direction">S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> enters hurriedly, holding
his handkerchief to his face; he wears a white hat, red scarf, white waistcoat, cutaway
coat, and very gay trousers; carries an umbrella.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>walking up and down</i>). The young
vagabond<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
deliberately put his toe on a loose stone and squirted half a pint of muddy water into my
eye! I saw him do it. He must be an old hand at it too, or he wouldn’t have taken such a
good aim; but, luckily, I spied his name on his basket, and if I don’t spoil his trade for
potatoes in this establishment my name’s not Skruff! (<i>Takes out a note-book and writes
in it “Spronks.”</i>) There! and now, Spronks, my boy, look out for squalls! Some people
may like being insulted with impunity—I don’t.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span> (<i>who has been following </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> to and fro the stage, at last stops him by the
coat-tail</i>). Now, then! what’s your business, young man?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. “Young man!”</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. If you’ve come for the water-rate—or the gas—or
the sewers—you must call again!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Water-rate! Gas! Are you aware, young woman,
that you’re addressing a gentleman?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. You don’t mean it? Well, that’s about the last
thing I should have thought of! It only shows one mustn’t always judge by appearances.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>with importance</i>). I happen to be a
friend of your master’s.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Well, I <i>am</i> surprised—’cause master’s so
very particular—then how came you to ring the servants’ bell?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). I never <i>shall</i> get out of
that habit—been used to it so long, I suppose. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Is Mr. Gritty down?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Can’t say, I’m sure, sir—but I know he ain’t
up.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Oh! at what time does he usually get up?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Well, sir, that depends; but, as a rule, I’ve
observed he usually gets up about his usual time.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Does he indeed? (<i>Aside.</i>) There’s a
flippancy about this young woman I don’t like. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Perhaps the young ladies,
Mr. Gritty’s nieces, are down?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Can’t say positively, sir—but I know they ain’t
up.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). I shall not interrogate this
domestic any<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
further. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Will you inform Mr. Gritty, with my compliments, that I have
called to see him?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Certainly, sir—but—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>impressively</i>). I repeat, Will you
inform Mr. Gritty that I have called? Do you think you can manage that?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Well, sir, don’t you think it would be as well
just to mention the name? Do you think you can manage that? Shall I take your card,
sir?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Yes! (<i>taking out card-case</i>). No!
(<i>Aside.</i>) Cards cost a shilling a hundred. Why should I waste one on people I’ve
hardly ever seen. (<i>Aloud.</i>) You can say—“Mr. Samuel Skruff.” Do you think you can
remember that?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. “Skruff!” Not likely to forget it, sir—such an
aristocratic name. (<i>Bringing forward a three-legged rustic seat.</i>) Like to sit down,
sir?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>heard from house at <span
class="stage">L</span>.</i>). Sally! My shaving water!—hot! all hot!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span>. Coming, sir!</p>

<p class="direction_2">[<i>Runs into house <span class="stage">L</span>.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Her name’s Sally, is it? (<i>writing in
note-book</i>). Down goes Sally along-side of Spronks. (<i>Seats himself and almost
tumbles over.</i>) What the deuce does old Gritty mean by having such rickety things as
this about the premises?—to do a good turn to the wooden-leg makers, I suppose!
(<i>Sitting down very cautiously.</i>) Now let me see what I’ve come down here for
(<i>consults note-book</i>). Here we have it! (<i>Reads.</i>) “Florence Halliday,” “Hetty
Halliday”—old Gritty’s two nieces. The fact is, dad wants to see me settled; that is, if I
can make a good thing out of it! Well, he’s just heard on the extreme quiet that one of
the young ladies is very soon coming in for £10,000!—unluckily he doesn’t know which of
the two—so, on the strength of a former business acquaintance with old Gritty, he has
trotted me down here to ferret the secret out, and if I get hold of the right scent I am
to go the entire animal at once!—not likely I should waste any time about courtship and
all that sort of thing. Not I! Only<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-150">[Pg 150]</a></span> let me worm out which of the two has got the tin, and
I’ll marry her to-morrow morning!—I can’t say fairer than that! (<i>Looking about
him.</i>) Rather a niceish sort of place this! must have cost something! I hope old Gritty
can afford it. Father says he was always fond of squandering his money and doing good.
Doing good!—what is it, after all?—getting up a vainglorious reputation at the expense of
people who stick to their money!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>without, at <span
class="stage">L</span>.</i>). In the garden, is he? All right! I’ll find him!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span><i> from villa
<span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.</i></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Where is he? (<i>he is in his morning-gown,
and wears a wide-brimmed straw hat—sees </i>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>). Ah!
my dear Samuel—(<i>seizing and shaking </i>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>’<span
class="smallerfont">S</span><i> hand violently</i>)—delighted to see you, Samuel—for I
suppose you are Samuel—eh, Samuel? And how’s your father, Samuel?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Quite well, thank you, Mr. Gritty.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. And your mother, too, Samuel?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Quite well, thank you, Mr. Gritty.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. And your sisters—and your uncles—and your
aunts—and all the rest of ’em—eh, Samuel?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Quite well, thank you, Mr. Gritty.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Bless me, what a time it is since I’ve seen
any of you—and to think that your father and I were partners when you were a baby—and a
precious ugly little brat you were! I don’t see much alteration in you <i>now,</i>
Samuel—I mean, not for the better. Yes, “Gritty &amp; Skruff,” that was the name of the
firm—“tailors”—“Conduit Street”—and a capital business it was, too—and is so still, I
hope.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Yes; better than ever. Father’s made heaps
more money since you retired! Trade’s altered completely!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Has it? When I was in it we gave a first-rate
article, paid good wages, and were satisfied with a fair profit.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. We manage matters better than that
<i>now!</i></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. How so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. By adding the profit on to both ends. Putting
down the wages and putting up the prices.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Well, well, every one to his taste! Your
father chose London smoke and slaving on to amass a fortune. <i>I</i> preferred fresh air
and a moderate competence, and so we parted. You’ll stay and dine with us to-day, of
course?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Thank you, Mr. Gritty. (<i>Aside</i>). I put a
paper of sandwiches in my pocket. Never mind, they’ll keep a day or two.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. And after dinner you can tell me to what I’m
indebted for the pleasure of this visit. (<i>Suddenly</i>). By-the-bye, you’ll have a
glass of wine? Of course you will! (<i>Calling.</i>) Sally! bring in that decanter of port
out of the sideboard!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). What extravagance!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Ha! ha! I remember I never could get your
father to drink anything stronger than raspberry vinegar drowned in water—and what a
wretched looking object he was!—the color of gingerbread and as thin as a pair of
nut-crackers! Do you know, Samuel, the more I look at you the more you remind me of
him?</p>

<p class="direction_3"><i>Enter </i>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span><i> from house
with decanter and wine-glasses on a tray, which she places on a small table in <span

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>pouring out a glass of wine</i>). There,
Samuel—tell me what you think of that (S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> sips the
wine</i>). Zounds, man, it won’t hurt you, down with it! (S<span
class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> takes down the wine at a gulp, almost choking
himself.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>after tossing off his glass of wine</i>).
How the deuce is it that my old friend Skruff hasn’t found his way down to see me all
these years?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Well, the fact is, Mr. Gritty, my father has
often talked of paying you a visit— Thank you, I don’t mind taking just one more glass
(<i>holding out his glass to </i>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>,<i> who fills
it—</i>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> tosses it down.</i>) Let me see—I was
saying—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. That your father has often talked of paying me
a visit.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Exactly—but the fact is— Well, since you
insist upon it, I don’t mind just <i>half</i> a glass more (<i>holding out his
glass—</i>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span><i> fills it half full.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. I think you said <i>half</i> a glass?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Did I?—far be it from me to contradict you,
but—(G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span><i> laughs and fills up </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>’<span class="smallerfont">S</span><i> glass, which
</i>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> again tosses off.</i>)</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Now you haven’t told me why my old friend
hasn’t been down to see me all these years.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Well, the fact is, it’s such an awful expense
to get down here!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. What! from Putney to Teddington—eighteenpence
second-class return? Surely that wouldn’t have ruined him!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). If ever old Gritty becomes my
uncle-in-law, I shall have to put a stop to all these extravagant notions of his.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Well, it seems <i>you</i> didn’t grudge the
expense.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Not a bit of it, because I didn’t go to it! I
got a lift in our butcher’s cart to Richmond—then on to Twickenham with a benevolent
baker, and walked the rest.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>aside</i>). A careful young man this! but
I’m afraid my old friend has made a trifling mistake in his calculations. He used to say
it was time enough to make a gentleman when you’d made your money—but in my opinion, a man
can’t begin a bit too soon! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Now, Sammy, come and take a stroll round the
grounds, and I’ll introduce you to my nieces, a couple of nice girls, Sammy! I hope you’re
a lady’s man (<i>poking him in the ribs</i>), ha! ha!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Well, as a <i>rule,</i> the sex <i>is</i>
rather partial to me!—ha! ha! (<i>giving </i>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span><i> a
poke in the ribs</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Is it? Well, there’s no accounting for
taste!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. You see, father’s well off—and the pickings
’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-153">[Pg 153]</a></span> uncommon
good when the old boy pops off!—a great attraction to the female mind, Mr. Gritty!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. I dare say; but luckily, my girls will not
have to look to <i>money</i> as the main thing! (<i>Looking round, and then in a
confidential whisper to </i>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>.) Ten thousand pounds,
left by a rich old aunt! which may probably fall to—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>very eagerly</i>). Yes! to—to—</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>). Florence!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Oh! that’s the one, is it?
(<i>Writing aside in note-book.</i>) Then down she goes, “Sally! Spronks! Florence!”</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span> (<i>continuing</i>). Unless, indeed—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Unless, indeed, what?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Hetty should turn out to be the lucky one!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Who’s to make head or tail out
of this? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Then you don’t exactly know which of the two it is?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. No, but I <i>shall,</i> as soon as Hetty comes
of age, by which time, by-the-bye, both the girls must, according to the terms of the
will, be married.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Oh! (<i>Aside.</i>) It strikes me this is a
dodge to get the two girls off with one legacy! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And when <i>does</i> Miss
Hetty come of age?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. In ten days.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Ten days? Rather a short time to provide two
husbands in?</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Not at all! They’re already provided!—both of
’em!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Already provided! (<i>Aside.</i>) And this is
what I get for coming down here and wasting my income in travelling expenses! but I’ll
make a fight of it yet! If they think they’re going to walk over the course they’ll find
themselves mistaken! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And what sort of articles are these young chaps, eh?
You can’t be too particular in selecting the <i>pattern,</i> Mr. Gritty.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Oh, they’re all right!—nice gentlemanly young
fellows!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Take care, Mr. Gritty!—I know pretty well what
the general run of “gentlemanly young fellows” is!—they’re uncommon fond of running long
tailors’ bills!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Well, you shall judge for yourself—they both
dine here to-day!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. To-day? (<i>Aside.</i>) Then I haven’t much
time to lose if I’m to cut ’em out! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You haven’t told me their names.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Oh! one is a military man, Captain Taunton of
the Buffs—the other, Edward Mallingford, of the War Office!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Don’t remember either of their
names—but they’re sure to be in debt somewhere or other—if I only had time to find out
<i>where!</i> (<i>Aloud.</i>) And pray, which is which destined for, Mr. Gritty?
(<i>Aside.</i>) It’s important for me to know that! (<i>taking out his pocket-book on the
sly</i>).</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Oh, there’s no secret about it—Florence is
engaged to— (<i>Seeing </i>F<span class="smallerfont">LORENCE</span>,<i> who enters from

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Oh! uncle, dear! why do you ask your dreadful

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. And we’ve such a nice boat, Mr. Skruff!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. You can paddle yourself about in it for hours,
Mr. Skruff!</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. Yes, the longer the better, Mr. Skruff!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Were you ever introduced to such an

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. With me?</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. With you? Don’t flatter yourself! with
<i>me!</i> He was on the point of saying something very tender to me when you jealously
monopolized his attention!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Nonsense! I’m sure he was about to declare his
passion for me when you cruelly dragged him away!</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. Then it’s quite clear he means to marry one of
us! If he honors <i>me</i> with the preference, I must refer him to Mallingford, ha!
ha!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

any objection to my sharing in the joke?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. None at all, Harry; it simply means that Hetty
is likely to become “Mrs. Samuel Skruff” <i>vice</i> “Edward Mallingford,” cashiered.</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. Don’t be quite so positive, because it isn’t
<i>quite</i> decided yet whether it will not be “Samuel Skruff” <i>vice</i> “Henry
Taunton.” He’s a tailor, and a capital hand at cutting out.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. A very bad joke that (<i>they all laugh</i>);
but of course you can’t be serious?</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. That will entirely depend, most gallant
captain, on whether you are prepared to resign your pretensions! Your rival is a regular
fire-eater, I can assure you.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. And consequently one who would stand any amount
of—kicking, eh?</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Ha! ha! But don’t you think it’s high time we
dropped the tailor?</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Certainly!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. But tell me, Harry, have you arranged for the

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Yes! and upon the most favorable terms.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Then, not a single word to uncle on the subject
until we give you permission. Remember that!</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>. Well, I must run away. You’ll have some little

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. All I know of the interesting object of your

Florence’s entreaties. One thing is quite certain—Mr. Gritty must know nothing about
it.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>watching him over his newspaper</i>). Old
Gritty must know nothing about <i>what?</i></p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. The old gentleman has such a horror of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Oh! oh! accommodation-bills, eh? That’s your
little game, my fine fellow, is it? I’ve got him safe enough now, and can split upon him
at any time. I wonder what he’s reading? (<i>Seeing </i>T<span

over his shoulder at the letter—stumbles.</i>)</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>looking round—aside</i>). The tailor!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Perhaps you would like to read my private letters, sir?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. I should, very much— I mean no, of course
not.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. What were you going to say, Mr.—Stuff?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Skruff! (<i>Aside.</i>) I wish Miss Hetty had
broken the “painful intelligence” to him herself. I don’t relish the idea of being
“snuffed out” at thirty paces. Never mind, I’ll risk it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Captain Taunton,
I believe?</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Well, sir, what then? (<i>angrily</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Now don’t be jumping down my throat because
I’ve an unpleasant duty to perform. In a word—I deeply regret to inform you—</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>fiercely</i>). <i>You,</i> sir?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. I mean. Miss Halliday begs me to inform
you—</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>impetuously</i>). Go on!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. I’m going to go on, sir.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Miss Halliday begs you to inform me—what?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. That when she accepted you as a friend of the
family she had no intention whatever of accepting you as a <i>husband</i>—and <i>now,</i>
she <i>thinks</i>—I mean, <i>imagines</i>—I should say, <i>believes,</i> she’s made a
slight mistake, because she finds she likes somebody else <i>better.</i></p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. What! (<i>seizing </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span><i> by the collar and shaking him.</i>)</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. It’s no use giving way to your “savage
ferocity,” sir; if you don’t believe me, you’d better go and ask Miss Hetty yourself.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>leaving hold of </i>S<span
class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>). <i>Hetty!</i> Did you say Hetty? (<i>Aside.</i>) One of
her practical jokes evidently. Ha! ha! ha!<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>in a compassionate tone to </i>T<span
class="smallerfont">AUNTON</span>,<i> who has still got his handkerchief to his face, and
patting him commiseratingly on the back</i>). Now don’t go and make yourself miserable
because another fellow has stepped into the ten thousand pounds!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>aside</i>). The mercenary rascal! I see
Hetty’s “little game” now.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Keep your pecker up, noble captain. I didn’t
mean to cut you out, upon my life I didn’t!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>aside</i>). I’ll humor the fellow.
(<i>Aloud, and with a very deep sigh.</i>) Well, Mr.—Mr.—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. One moment (<i>presents card to </i>T<span
class="smallerfont">AUNTON</span>).</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>reading</i>). “Skruff—Tailor—Conduit
Street. Orders promptly attended to.” Your information, Mr. Skruff, I confess, is not a
pleasant one! Far from it, Mr. Skruff! (<i>gives a very deep sigh</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Now don’t go on sighing like that, or you’ll
be doing yourself some frightful internal injury!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Hetty will make you a good wife, Mr. Skruff,
and a good mother to the little Skruffs, Mr. Skruff. Might I ask to be allowed to stand
godfather to your first, Mr. Skruff?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. My dear sir, you shall stand godfather to the
first dozen or two if you like!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Thank you, Mr. Skruff—but alas! alas! what is
to become of the poor abandoned, broken-hearted Taunton? (<i>another very deep
sigh</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Well! I don’t like to advise—but I really
don’t see why you shouldn’t chuck yourself in the water, especially if you can’t swim!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. (<i>very quietly</i>). Drown myself—not I! I
shall at once propose to the other sister!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aghast</i>). What! (<i>seeing letter on
stage, and putting his foot on it</i>). You mean to propose to Miss Florence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Yes! this very day, this very hour! I suppose I
shall be safe in that quarter? You won’t have the heart to molest me <i>there,</i> Mr.
Skruff. (<i>Aside.</i>) Now to let Mallingford know about this wretched little interloper!
I shall be sure to meet him coming from the station! (<i>Aloud, and grasping </i>S<span

Good-bye, Mr. Skruff! you have acted nobly!—nobly!—nobly, Mr. Skruff!</p>

<p class="direction_3">[<i>Shaking his hand violently, and going off at gate <span

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Have I? Don’t be too sure about that! Wheugh!
I’ve got the most excruciating attack of pins and needles all up my leg in trying to hide
this letter! (<i>Picks it up.</i>) The question is, ought I to read it? Of course I ought,
or how should I know what’s in it. Here goes! (<i>Reading letter.</i>) “Dear Harry, I can

conceal this from Mr. Gritty. Yours, Teddy.” Teddy!—Teddy what? Teddy who? Yes; I remember
now—I’ve got him down somewhere! (<i>looking at his memorandum-book</i>). Here he
is!—“Edward Mallingford”—he’s old Gritty’s other young man! Here’s a bit of luck!—I’ve got
both the young chaps in my clutches now. Ha! ha!—but stop a bit—(<i>reflecting</i>). Isn’t
it rather strange, if the captain was <i>really</i> in love with Hetty, that he should
give her up so quietly?—then the eagerness with which he bound me down not to cut him out
with Florence. What if the money comes to <i>her</i> after all! Luckily, I haven’t quite

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Skruff—but your merriment is an

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Another broken-hearted one! It
runs in the family!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Besides, even if Captain Taunton resigns in your

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. He <i>has!</i> in the handsomest manner! He’s
even proposed to stand godfather to our first! but, says I, “No, Taunton, my boy,

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. <i>Dearest</i> miss—you may!</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Then I may venture to ask your advice on a

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Now for Teddy! If Teddy doesn’t

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Exactly!—do you know him?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Personally, no!—professionally, as the signer

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Yes! it was a gigantic mistake on your old

have seen that he only came here after your ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. (<i>smiling</i>). <i>My</i> ten thousand

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>in a sympathizing tone</i>). It must be

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Would that all men were as disinterested as you,

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. True, Miss Florence—for my part, if I were to
marry a young lady with ten thousand pounds—</p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. You’d settle it all on herself—I <i>know</i>—I’m

you! To help her to tend her flowers—to feed her poultry—to grow her own currants and
gooseberries—</p>

I’ll do all I can for you, I will indeed.</p>

the conclusion that your affections are fixed on the younger of Mr. Gritty’s nieces, Miss
Hetty?</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Sir! (<i>indignantly</i>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Now don’t fly out in that way—it’s perfectly
immaterial to me—you can have your choice—nothing can be fairer than that!</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Before I reply to <i>your</i> question,
Mr.—Mr.—</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Skruff.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. Mr. Skruff—perhaps you’ll be good enough to
answer mine—how did you come to open a letter addressed to another?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. How did I open it? In the usual way, I assure
you.</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. For which I have half a mind to give you a
sound horsewhipping!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. My dear sir, as long as you have only
<i>half</i> a mind, and <i>keep</i> to it, you may threaten me as much as you think
proper. Besides, sir, as I flatter myself that Miss Florence honors me with her
partiality—(<i>bowing to </i>F<span class="smallerfont">LORENCE</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>F<span class="smallerfont">LOR</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Skruff! Flattered by your
proposal, but compelled to decline (<i>courtesying very low and giving her hand to
</i>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNTON</span>).</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). That’s no go. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
How silly of me, to be sure! Of course, when I said Miss <i>Florence</i> I meant Miss
<i>Hetty</i> (<i>about to advance</i>).</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">ALLING</span>. (<i>meeting him</i>). Pardon me, Mr. Skruff!
I have a prior claim (<i>holding out his hand to </i>H<span
class="smallerfont">ETTY</span>). Dear Hetty!</p>

<p>H<span class="smallerfont">ETTY</span> (<i>giving her hand to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">ALLINGFORD</span>). Dear Teddy!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span> (<i>aside</i>). Another no go.</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Why, Sammy, what a desperate fellow you
are—have you been falling in love with <i>both</i> my girls?</p>

<p>T<span class="smallerfont">AUNT</span>. With neither, Mr. Gritty—but desperately
smitten with their ten thousand pounds!</p>

<p>G<span class="smallerfont">RITTY</span>. Oh! oh! that was your little game, eh,
Sam?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. I’ll trouble you not to <i>Sam</i> me, Mr.
Gritty! I beg you to understand that I’m not going to stand <i>Sam</i> any longer!
(<i>drawing himself up</i>). I sha’n’t stop to dinner, Gritty!</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">LL</span> (<i>with pretended regret, and in a very appealing
tone</i>). Oh, don’t say so!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. But I <i>do</i> say so.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">ALLY</span> (<i>aside to him</i>). <i>Now</i> you haven’t
told me which is the taters, sir!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">KRUFF</span>. Open the gate, young woman! (S<span
class="smallerfont">ALLY</span><i> goes to open gate.</i>) Good-morning, Mr. Gritty!
Good-morning, ladies! I hope you’ll be happy—though I wouldn’t give much for your chance.
(<i>Advancing rapidly to the front.</i>) After all, perhaps I’ve had a narrow escape—who
knows but I may have cause to be grateful that I <i>have</i> been declined—</p>

<p>A<span class="smallerfont">LL</span> (<i>with low courtesies and bows</i>). With
thanks!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
